<p>“Work” shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object

separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

<p>“Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

<p>“Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>GRANT OF COPYRIGHT LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GRANT OF PATENT LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>REDISTRIBUTION. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
following conditions:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a.  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
    copy of this License; and</p>

<p>b.  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and</p>

<p>c.  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>

<p>d.  If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
    such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
    part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
    Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
    provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
    generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
    notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
    informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
    add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
    Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
    construed as modifying the License.</p>

<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
  provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
  Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
  distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
  in this License.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by

separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TRADEMARKS. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
