title: Rotary Simplifies Online Access for Members with Okta

title_tagline:  >
  Okta enriches the online Rotary experience by integrating legacy and third-party platforms with a new central Rotary authentication system, enabling members of the Rotary community worldwide to work more effectively and productively for the good of their neighbors

index_blurb: >
  By centralizing authentication and user management with Okta, Rotary International can now crowd-source applications from its community and make these available to over 1.2M members with just one set of credentials.

sidebar_testimonial: >
  Okta had the best approach for what we needed. They had a more complete vision to managing identity, and the integration and single sign-on approach was very consistent with what we needed to have happen in the coming years for our user base.

  * Rotary needed to unify authentication for its suite of applications for over 1.2M members, and provide for an integrated experience across crowd-sourced applications created by the Rotary community.

  * The Okta Identity Platform's single sign-on identity provider and Universal Directory with integration to Rotary's CRM system, provide a unified view of all members and seamless access across a suite of applications.

## About Rotary International
Rotary International supports over 34,000 clubs in over 200 countries. A total of 1.2 million men and women are Rotarians. The organization’s wide range of charitable activities include everything from local literacy programs and food banks to co-leading the  global effort to eradicate polio, a goal 99 percent accomplished. Rotary’s international partners include the World Health Organization and UNICEF.


## Situation: Fluid access rights, siloed applications

Rotary International's global network of clubs and members makes identity and information management a challenge. Rotary's applications are largely identity driven; the position a member holds in the organization, for example, dictates which information he or she can (and should) access. These identity-driven access requirements also extend to the many donors who contribute to Rotary causes. As Peter Markos, Rotary's Chief Information officer, explains, "Identity is at the core of what we provide our members. We need to know who you are, and we also need to know when you are that role." To compound this complexity, roles within individual clubs change annually, making for highly fluid identity authentication and access requirements.
Rotary's informational sites and applications have evolved over the years as a series of standalone applications. Applications range from simple html landing pages to cloud-based eLearning portals and grant application tools. This diverse set of applications placed a heavy burden on Rotary's legacy identity platform architecture. "When you look at our systems," Markos continues, "as a non-profit we're dealing with some fairly legacy applications. We just found our technology was antiquated and wouldn't really meet our members' needs, and so what we really wanted to do was move our organization forward. We want to make sure we give them tools that match their expertise." Compounding this challenge were several valuable applications created and launched by individual Rotarians. Rotary members were unable to find value in these crowd-sourced applications because identity-based access and authentication from Rotary International's master data set was not easily available. "As often happens when you have a lot of home-grown applications, each one is built, if you will, with its own little quirks," Markos notes. "And what we're trying to do is move toward a standard model, where we're taking advantage of the efficiencies gained by a typical, standard implementation."


## Solution: Centralized authentication, provisioning, and a unified view of each user

Markos considered several identity services before choosing Okta. Okta's identity service provides Rotary with a cloud-based directory that has enabled Rotary to migrate toward a single sign-on portal for its members and donors. The Okta service, moreover, is embedded completely within Rotary's infrastructure, so that user authentication, account creation, and access rights are entirely consistent with the Rotary interfaces users have come to know and recognize.
The Okta REST API enables developers to leverage Okta's comprehensive identity platform programmatically, essentially embedding Okta within their products or sites.  Through the Okta API, Rotary was able to leverage the Okta platform to unify authentication.  As a highly scalable, always available service, Okta is able to support Rotary's rapidly growing user population.  Okta's provisioning capability, utilized via REST API, also enables Rotary to provision applications to a broad range of users, which has greatly simplified the "who you are" and "when you are" aspects of Rotary's identity management requirements. "Okta today is definitely making a difference in terms of managing our identity element," Markos says. "We're now using Okta for authentication, so we know who our members are and whether or not they're able to successfully login to our system. We're also integrating them into our CRM, so we know what role they are, and also when they are that role."


## Benefits: Modern scalable architecture, simplified end user experience

### Modernized Identity Architecture

Okta's cloud-based identity service is allowing Rotary to migrate off of its legacy platforms and modernize its applications. "What we're trying to do is move toward a standard model," Markos says. "As we've implemented several cloud offerings, such as eLearning and our online grant application tool, we really wanted to use industry-standard technology to provide single sign-on." By providing Rotary with a flexible, scalable identity platform, Okta has laid the ground work for future infrastructure improvements. As Markos notes, "Our identity model can be replicated across every other system as we go through our updates of our technology in the coming years."

### Simplified, Improved End User Experience

"From my perspective," Markos says, "the most important thing is the end-user experience. One of the things we're looking to do is to make our applications as simple and easy for our members to get to as possible." Okta's identity solution is helping Markos realize his goal of improving the way users interact with Rotary's website, particularly in the accessibility and richness of tools and applications that are vital to Rotarians' goals. "We want users to come to Rotary.org and use that as a hub to get access to all the tools that are available, both from Rotary International but also potentially the tools they've sourced themselves," Markos continues. "We want to make sure we give them tools that match their experience. That's one of the reasons we ultimately chose Okta, as their identity solution really simplifies the end-user experience significantly."

### Unified Access Across In-House Sites and 3rd Party Applications

Not all of the applications Rotarians may want to use are available through the Rotary.org website. "Our members are very entrepreneurial people," Markos explains. "They're professionals in their communities, and they have a lot of different skills. Many of them are IT professionals. One of our members, for example, recently spent 3 million dollars developing an application for Rotarians to use to help them connect and collaborate. An amazing, amazing application." But, as Markos notes, the developer faced a significant problem: "How do you get 1.2 million members to actually access it and use it? He doesn't have a data base of who our members are; he can't prove someone's a Rotarian or not. We talked about how we can integrate you into our model where Okta, if you will, is providing identity management to the Rotarian world, so a user can go to his website, login in with his Rotary.org credentials, and get full access to what they need. Okta's providing not just successful authentication, but the key demographic information about what club they're a part of and what their role is, so that within that application they're getting the right permissions. That's the future for Rotary, where we're crowd-sourcing access to functionality." As Markos points out, this ability also has real, practical benefits for Rotarians. "What Okta's helping us do is lower barriers, by making it easy for your everyday Rotarian to go, 'I know how to get into this new functionality: I just use my same ID and password.' They get right to the good stuff and the value, as opposed to having hurdles to jump through."
