In the event Customer becomes aware of any violation of the terms of Section 2.2 by its Users, Customer shall immediately terminate such User’s account access.</p>

<p>2.4 Review of Customer Applications. Okta reserves the right to review Customer Applications that Customer has made or intends to make commercially available upon written request, and Customer will provide Okta with reasonable access to the Customer Application for such purposes within a reasonable time following such written request.</p>

<h2 id="4-confidentiality">4. Confidentiality.</h2>

<p>As used herein, “Confidential Information” means, in the case of information disclosed by Okta to Customer, the Developer Service, Documentation and any information disclosed in connection with provision of support, and in the case of information disclosed by Customer to Okta, the Customer Data. The party receiving Confidential Information (the “Receiving Party”) shall not disclose or use any Confidential Information of the party disclosing Confidential Information (the “Disclosing Party”) for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, except with the Disclosing Party’s prior written permission. Each party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of like kind, but in no event shall either party exercise less than reasonable care in protecting such Confidential Information.  If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance. The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 4 do not apply to information that (i) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained either directly or indirectly from the Disclosing Party; (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of or reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.</p>

<h2 id="5-ownership">5. Ownership.</h2>

Okta shall have the right to host, copy, transmit, display, process and access the Customer Data solely as necessary for Okta to provide the Developer Service in accordance with this Agreement. Okta shall have the right to use any data generated in connection with the Developer Service (e.g., types of web applications utilized), provided, however, in the event Okta provides such data to third parties, it shall be anonymized and presented in the aggregate so that it cannot be linked specifically to Customer or its User.  The foregoing shall not limit in any way Okta’s confidentiality obligations pursuant to Section 4 above. Customer shall, and hereby does, grant Okta a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use, copy, modify, or distribute, including by incorporating into the Developer Service any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by Customer or its Users relating to the operation of the Developer Service (collectively “Feedback”). Okta shall have no obligation to incorporate any Feedback into the Developer Service. Customer shall have no obligation to provide any Feedback.</p>

<h2 id="6-fees-and-taxes">6. Fees and Taxes.</h2>

<p>6.1   Developer Service Provided Free of Charge.  The Developer Service is provided free of charge to Customer up to certain limits specified by Okta at developer.okta.com/pricing (e.g., total number of User logins, features offered, etc.). Any usage of the Developer Services in excess of the limits specified by Okta (as measured by Okta based upon the Developer Service log files) is subject to fees as set forth at developer.okta.com/pricing and Section 6.2 below.  Okta reserves the right to change its pricing policies for the Developer Service at any time in its sole discretion, including by discontinuing the availability of the Developer Services. Okta will provide Customer with reasonable notice of any such changes.</p>

<p>6.2   Developer Service Provided for a Fee. Within fifteen (15) days of the date Customer’s usage of the Developer Services first exceeds the limits specified by Okta for free use, Customer shall enter into a binding order for purchase of subscriptions to the Developer Services based upon Customer’s good faith estimate of anticipated annual usage of the Developer Services by its Users (each, an “Order”).  Such subscriptions shall renew automatically for additional periods of one (1) year each unless and until either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration date.  In the event Customer shall place incremental Orders promptly in the event its actual usage exceeds its then-current licensed capacity. Fees for use of the Developer Service (“Fees”) will be invoiced in accordance with the invoicing schedule specified in the applicable Order(s). Customer shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of date of invoice.  Customer agrees that the Developer Service purchased hereunder is neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features nor dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Okta regarding future functionality or features. All subscriptions purchased hereunder are non-cancellable and Fees paid and payable to Okta hereunder are nonrefundable.  If Customer fails to pay any amounts due under this Agreement by the due date, Okta will have the right to charge interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until Customer pays all amounts due; provided that Okta will not exercise its right to charge interest if the applicable charges are under reasonable and good faith dispute and Customer is cooperating diligently to resolve the issue.  Unless otherwise stated, Fees do not include any local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, use or withholding taxes (collectively, “Taxes”).  Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder (excluding taxes based on Okta’s net income or property), even if such amounts are not listed in the applicable invoice.</p>

<h2 id="7--limited-warranty-disclaimer">7.  Limited Warranty; Disclaimer.</h2>

<p>Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power to enter into this Agreement. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, THE DEVELOPER SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND OKTA AND ITS SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL (AND HAVE NOT AUTHORIZED ANYONE TO MAKE ANY) WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, PROMISES, COVENANTS OR UNDERTAKING RELATING TO THE DEVELOPER SERVICE OR OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NEITHER OKTA NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE DEVELOPER SERVICE OR THAT THE DEVELOPER SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY GIVEN TIME.</p>

<h2 id="8-limitation-of-liability">8. Limitation of Liability.</h2>

<p>8.1 NEITHER OKTA NOR OKTA’S SUPPLIERS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE, LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, (B) FOR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES, RIGHTS, OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<p>8.2 IN NO EVENT WILL OKTA’S OR ITS SUPPLIER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID TO OKTA BY CUSTOMER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM.</p>

<h2 id="9-indemnification">9. Indemnification.</h2>

<p>Customer shall defend Okta from any and all claims, demands, suits or proceedings (“Claims”) brought against Okta by a third party (including but not limited to Customer’s Users) alleging the Customer Data, the Customer Application, or other materials developed by Customer using the Developer Service (a) infringe or misappropriate a third party’s rights, (to the extent such infringement or misappropriation does not arise from the Developer Service), (b) violate applicable law, or (c) have otherwise harmed a third party.  Customer will indemnify Okta for all damages and/or costs (including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, or paid to a third party in accordance with a settlement agreement signed by Customer in connection with any such Claims. The indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 9 are Customer’s sole and exclusive obligations, and Okta’s sole and exclusive remedies, with respect to infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights of any kind.  Okta must give Customer: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim, (b) all cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by Customer in the defense of the Claim, at Customer’s sole expense, and (c) sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that Okta may participate in the defense of the Claim at its sole expense, and Customer may not, without the prior written consent of Okta, enter into a settlement to the extent such settlement restricts the business or operations of Okta.</p>

<h2 id="10-no-endorsement-customer-mention">10. No Endorsement; Customer Mention.</h2>

<p>10.1  No Endorsement.</p>

<p>NO ENDORSEMENT OF OR PARTICIPATION BY ANY THIRD PARTY SHOULD BE INFERRED DUE TO ANY REFERENCE TO THAT THIRD PARTY OR INCLUSION OF DATA RELATING TO THAT THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVELOPER SERVICE.  The Developer Service may allow Customer’s Users to interface with a variety of third party software and services obtained separately by Customer or its End Users (“Third Party Services”).  Okta is not responsible for the operation or functionality of such Third Party Services or for the operation or functionality of the Customer Application.  Any exchange of Customer Data or other information between Customer’s End Users and any Third Party Services are solely between Customer, its End Users, and the applicable third-party provider. While Okta may, in its sole discretion, configure the Developer Service to interoperate with various Third Party Services, (i) Okta cannot and does not guarantee that the Developer Service shall interoperate (or continue to interoperate) with any particular Third Party Service or with the Customer Application, and (ii) Okta’s obligations described in this Agreement shall not extend to any Third Party Services or to the Customer Application or to Customer’s Users.</p>

<p>10.2  Customer Mention. Notwithstanding any other term to the contrary, Okta may publicly disclose that Customer is a customer of the Developer Service and may use Customer’s name and logo to identify Customer as an Okta customer, including on Okta’s public website. Any use shall be subject to Okta complying with any written guidelines that Customer may deliver to Okta regarding the use of its name and logo.</p>

<h2 id="11-term-termination">11. Term; Termination.</h2>

<p>11.1  Term, Renewals.</p>

<p>This Agreement shall commence on the earlier of (i) the date that Customer accepts these terms or (ii) the date Customer first uses the Developer Service, and shall continue until all User subscriptions granted in accordance with this Agreement have expired or been terminated in accordance with this Section 11 (the “Term”).</p>

<p>11.2  Termination. If Okta determines, in its sole discretion, that Customer is using the Developer Service in a manner that violates this Agreement or creates an excessive burden or potential adverse impact on Okta’s systems, or the account is fifteen (15) days or more overdue (except with respect to charges then under reasonable and good faith dispute), in addition to any of its other rights or remedies, Okta may, without liability to Okta, immediately suspend Customer’s access to the Developer Service until such breach is cured. Either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event that such other party materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure such breach within fifteen (15) days of such notice.  In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice for its convenience.  Upon termination, the rights and licenses granted to Customer hereunder shall terminate immediately. In the event of any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer shall have no right to continue to resell the Developer Services, except that Agreement shall continue in full force and effect solely to the extent necessary for the parties to support Continuing Users for the remainder of their then-current subscription terms for the Developer Services, not to exceed one year from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, where a “Continuing User” means an end customer in the middle of an unexpired subscription term for the Developer Services at the time of termination of this Agreement.  The sections titled “Definitions,” “Restrictions”, “Customer Responsibilities,” “Confidentiality,” “Ownership,” “Fees and Taxes,” “Limited Warranty; Disclaimer,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “No Endorsement,” “Term; Termination,” and “General” shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

<p>11.3  Changes to this Agreement.  Okta may make changes to this Agreement from time to time upon fifteen (15) days notice.  At the conclusion of such fifteen (15) days notice period, such changes will take effect. Customer may reject the changes by terminating Customer’s account and this Agreement upon written notice provided during such fifteen (15) days notice period.  Any use of the Developer Service after the date on which the changes take effect shall be deemed acceptance of the updated terms of this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="12-general">12. General</h2>

<p>12.1  Assignment.  Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable or transferable by Customer without Okta’s prior written consent which shall not be unreasonable withheld or delayed, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect.</p>

<p>12.2  Controlling Law, Attorneys’ Fees and Severability.  This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or related hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws rules or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.  With respect to all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California.  In any action to enforce this Agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.  In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>

<p>12.3  Notices. All notices hereunder shall be in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested or by confirmed fax, and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon (i) personal delivery, (ii) five (5) days after sending, if sent by domestic mail; (iii) seven (7) days after sending, if sent by international mail; (iv) two (2) days after deposit with a recognized courier with next-day delivery instructions; (v) upon confirmation of transmission, if sent by confirmed fax, or (vi) with respect to notices to Customer, one business day after sending to Customer’s email address on record with Okta. Notices to Okta will be addressed to Legal Department, Okta, Inc., 301 Brannan St., Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94107, Fax: (415) 494-8052.</p>

<p>12.4  Force Majeure. If the performance of this Agreement or any obligation hereunder (other than obligations of payment) is prevented or restricted by reasons beyond the reasonable control of a party or its subcontractors, the party so affected shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention or restriction.

<p>12.5  Equitable Relief.  Due to the unique nature of the parties’ Confidential Information disclosed hereunder, there can be no adequate remedy at law for a party’s breach of its obligations hereunder, and any such breach may result in irreparable harm to the non-breaching party.  Therefore, upon any such breach or threat thereof, the party alleging breach shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available to it, without the requirement of posting a bond.</p>

<p>12.6  Independent Contractors. The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein shall constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent, or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.</p>

Customer will not and will not allow any third-party to remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Developer Service or any direct product thereof: (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria (to the extent the U.S. government or any agency thereof restricts export or re-export to such countries); (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority.

This U.S. Government End User Section 2(f) is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software or technical data.</p>

<p>12.9  Entire Agreement.
