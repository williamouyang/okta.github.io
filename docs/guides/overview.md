The Okta API is a versioned API. Okta reserves the right to add new parameters, properties, or resources to the API without advance notice. These updates are considered non-breaking and the compatibility rules below should be followed to ensure your application does not break. Breaking changes such as removing or renaming an attribute will be released as a new version of the API. Okta will provide a migration path for new versions of APIs and will communicate timelines for end-of-life when deprecating APIs.
