# OAuth 2.0 API

{% api_lifecycle ea %}

Okta is a fully standards-compliant [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/documentation) Authorization Server and a certified [OpenID Provider](http://openid.net/certification).

The OAuth 2.0 API provides API security via scoped access tokens, and OpenID Connect provides user authentication and an SSO layer which is lighter and easier to use than SAML.

To understand more about OAuth 2.0 and Okta:

* [Learn about how Okta implemented the OAuth 2.0 standards](/standards/OAuth/index.html)
* Explore the OAuth 2.0 API: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/e4d286b1af2294bb14a0)

## Endpoints

You can perform authorization and token operations, as well as create, configure, and delete Authorization Servers, policies, rules, scopes, and claims.

* [Authorization Operations](#authorization-operations)
* [Authorization Server Operations](#authorization-server-operations)
* [Policy Operations](#policy-operations)
* [Scope Operations](#scope-operations)

* [Authorization Server Key Store Operations](#authorization-server-key-store-operations)

### Authorization Operations

Retrieve the information you need to obtain an authorization grant; obtain, validate, and revoke a token; or manage keys.

* [Obtain an Authorization Grant from a User](#obtain-an-authorization-grant-from-a-user)
* [Request a Token](#request-a-token)
* [Introspection Request](#introspection-request)
* [Revoke a Token](#revoke-a-token)
* [Get Keys](#get-keys)
* [Retrieve Authorization Server Metadata](#retrieve-authorization-server-metadata)
* [Retrieve OpenID Connect Metadata](#retrieve-authorization-server-openid-connect-metadata)

#### Obtain an Authorization Grant from a User
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation get /oauth2/:authorizationServerId/v1/authorize %}

This is a starting point for OAuth 2.0 flows such as implicit and authorization code flows. This request authenticates the user and returns tokens along with an authorization grant to the client application as part of the response.

##### Request Parameters
{:.api .api-request .api-request-params}

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Type  | DataType | Required | Default          |

|     [idp](idps.html)      | The Identity provider used to do the authentication. If omitted, use Okta as the identity provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Query | String   | FALSE    | Okta is the IDP. |
| sessionToken          | An Okta one-time session token. This allows an API-based user login flow (rather than Okta login UI). Session tokens can be obtained via the     [Authentication API](authn.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Query | String   | FALSE    |                  |
| response_type         | Can be a combination of ``code``, ``token``, and ``id_token``. The chosen combination determines which flow is used; see this reference from the     [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.1). The code response type returns an authorization code which can be later exchanged for an Access Token or a Refresh Token.                                                                                    | Query | String   | TRUE     |                  |
| client_id             | Obtained during either     UI client registration or     [API client registration](oauth-clients.html).

| redirect_uri          | Specifies the callback location where the authorization code should be sent and it must match what has been registered in Okta during client registration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Query | String   | TRUE     |                  |
| display               | Specifies how to display the authentication and consent UI. Valid values: ``page`` or ``popup``.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Query | String   | FALSE    |                  |
| max_age               | Specifies the allowable elapsed time, in seconds, since the last time the end user was actively authenticated by Okta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Query | String   | FALSE    |                  |
| response_mode         | Specifies how the authorization response should be returned.     [Valid values: ``fragment``, ``form_post``, ``query`` or ``okta_post_message``](#request-parameter-details). If ``id_token`` or ``token`` is specified as the *response_type*, then ``query`` isn't allowed as a *response_mode*. Defaults to ``fragment`` in implicit and hybrid flows. Defaults to ``query`` in authorization code flow and cannot be set as ``okta_post_message``.  | Query | String   | FALSE    | See Description. |
| scope                 | Can be a combination of reserved scopes and custom scopes. The combination determines the claims that are returned in the Access Token and ID Token. The ``openid`` scope has to be specified to get back an ID Token. If omitted, the default scopes configured in the Authorization Server are used.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Query | String   | TRUE     |                  |
| state                 | A client application provided state string that might be useful to the application upon receipt of the response. It can contain alphanumeric, comma, period, underscore and hyphen characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Query | String   | TRUE     |                  |
| prompt                | Can be either ``none`` or ``login``. The value determines if Okta should not prompt for authentication (if needed), or force a prompt (even if the user had an existing session). Default: The default behavior is based on whether there's an existing Okta session.                                                                                                                                                                       | Query | String   | FALSE    | See Description. |
| nonce                 | Specifies a nonce that is reflected back in the ID Token. It is used to mitigate replay attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Query | String   | TRUE     |                  |
| code_challenge        | Specifies a challenge of     [PKCE](#request-parameter-details). The challenge is verified in the Token request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Query | String   | FALSE    |                  |
| code_challenge_method | Specifies the method that was used to derive the code challenge. Only S256 is supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Query | String   | FALSE    |                  |
| login_hint            | A username to prepopulate if prompting for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Query | String   | FALSE    |                  |
| idp_scope             | A space delimited list of scopes to be provided to the Social Identity Provider when performing [Social Login](social_authentication.html). These scopes are used in addition to the scopes already configured on the Identity Provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Query      | String   | FALSE    |

##### Request Parameter Details

 * *idp*, *sessionToken* and *idp_scope* are Okta extensions to the [OIDC specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication).
    All other parameters comply with the [OIDC specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and their behavior is consistent with the specification.
 * Each value for *response_mode* delivers different behavior:
    * ``fragment`` -- Parameters are encoded in the URL fragment added to the *redirect_uri* when redirecting back to the client.
    * ``query`` -- Parameters are encoded in the query string added to the *redirect_uri* when redirecting back to the client.
    * ``form_post`` -- Parameters are encoded as HTML form values that are auto-submitted in the User Agent.Thus, the values are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the client
      and the result parameters are encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
    * ``okta_post_message`` -- Uses [HTML5 Web Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) (for example, window.postMessage()) instead of the redirect for the authorization response from the authorization endpoint.
      ``okta_post_message`` is an adaptation of the [Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00#section-4.1).
      This value provides a secure way for a single-page application to perform a sign-in flow
      in a popup window or an iFrame and receive the ID token and/or access token back in the parent page without leaving the context of that page.
      The data model for the [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) call is in the next section.
 * Okta requires the OAuth 2.0 *state* parameter on all requests to the authorization endpoint in order to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    The OAuth 2.0 specification [requires](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12) that clients protect their redirect URIs against CSRF by sending a value in the authorize request which binds the request to the user-agent's authenticated state.
    Using the *state* parameter is also a countermeasure to several other known attacks as outlined in [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819).
 * [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) (PKCE) is a stronger mechanism for binding the authorization code to the client than just a client secret, and prevents [a code interception attack](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#section-1) if both the code and the client credentials are intercepted (which can happen on mobile/native devices). The PKCE-enabled client creates a large random string as *code_verifier* and derives *code_challenge* from it using the method specified in *code_challenge_method*.
    Then the client passes the *code_challenge* and *code_challenge_method* in the authorization request for code flow. When a client tries to redeem the code, it must pass the *code_verifer*. Okta recomputes the challenge and returns the requested token only if it matches the *code_challenge* in the original authorization request. When a client, whose *token_endpoint_auth_method* is ``none``, makes a code flow authorization request, *code_challenge* is required.
    Since *code_challenge_method* only supports S256, this means that the value for *code_challenge* must be: `BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(*code_verifier*)))`. According to the [PKCE spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636), the *code_verifier* must be at least 43 characters and no more than 128 characters.

##### postMessage() Data Model

Use the postMessage() data model to help you when working with the *okta_post_message* value of the *response_mode* request parameter.

*message*:

Parameter         | Description                                                                                        | DataType  |
----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------|
id_token          | The ID Token JWT contains the details of the authentication event and the claims corresponding to the requested scopes. This is returned if the `response_type` includes `id_token`. | String   |
access_token      | The *access_token* used to access `/oauth2/:authorizationServerId/v1/userinfo`. This is returned if the *response_type* included a token. <b>Important</b>: Unlike the ID Token JWT, the *access_token* structure is specific to Okta, and is subject to change. | String    |
state             | If the request contained a `state` parameter, then the same unmodified value is returned back in the response. | String    |
error             | The error-code string providing information if anything goes wrong.                                | String    |
error_description | Additional description of the error.                                                               | String    |

*targetOrigin*:

Specifies what the origin of *parentWindow* must be in order for the postMessage() event to be dispatched
(this is enforced by the browser). The *okta-post-message* response mode always uses the origin from the *redirect_uri*
specified by the client. This is crucial to prevent the sensitive token data from being exposed to a malicious site.

##### Response Parameters
{:.api .api-response .api-response-params}

The response depends on the response mode passed to the API. For example, a *fragment* response mode returns values in the fragment portion of a redirect to the specified *redirect_uri* while a *form_post* response mode POSTs the return values to the redirect URI.
Irrespective of the response mode, the contents of the response contains some of the following.

Parameter         | Description                                                                                        | DataType  |
----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------|
id_token          | The ID Token JWT contains the details of the authentication event and the claims corresponding to the requested scopes. This is returned if the *response_type* includes *id_token*.| String    |
access_token      | The *access_token* that is used to access the resource. This is returned if the *response_type* included a token. | String  |
token_type        | The token type is always `Bearer` and is returned only when *token* is specified as a *response_type*. | String |
code              | An opaque value that can be used to redeem tokens from [token endpoint](#request-a-token).| String    |
expires_in        | The number of seconds until the *access_token* expires. This is only returned if the response included an *access_token*. | String |
scope             | The scopes of the *access_token*. This is only returned if the response included an *access_token*. | String |
state             | The same unmodified value from the request is returned back in the response. | String |
error             | The error-code string providing information if anything went wrong. | String |
error_description | Further description of the error. | String |

##### Errors

| client_assertion_type | Indicates a JWT is being used to authenticate the client. Per the     [Client Authentication spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication), the valid value is `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.                                                                                     | String |

##### Refresh Tokens for Web and Native Applications

For web and native application types, an additional process is required:

1. Use the Okta Administration UI and check the **Refresh Token** checkbox under **Allowed Grant Types** on the client application page.
2. Pass the `offline_access` scope to your `/authorize` or `/token` request if you're using the `password` grant type.

##### Token Authentication Methods
<!--If you change this section, change the section in oidc.md as well -->

If you authenticate a client with client credentials, provide the [`client_id`](oidc.html#request-parameters)
and [`client_secret`](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect) using either of the following methods:

* Provide [`client_id`](oidc.html#request-parameters) and [`client_secret`](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect)
  in an Authorization header in the Basic auth scheme (`client_secret_basic`). For authentication with Basic auth, an HTTP header with the following format must be provided with the POST request:
  ~~~sh
  Authorization: Basic ${Base64(<client_id>:<client_secret>)}
  ~~~
* Provide [`client_id`](oidc.html#request-parameters) and [`client_secret`](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect)
  as additional parameters to the POST body (`client_secret_post`)
* Provide [`client_id`](oidc.html#request-parameters) in a JWT that you sign with the [`client_secret`](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect)
  using HMAC algorithms HS256, HS384, or HS512. Specify the JWT in `client_assertion` and the type, `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`, in `client_assertion_type` in the request. 

Use only one of these methods in a single request or an error will occur.

>If the value returned by `token_endpoint_auth_method` in the [OAuth 2.0 Clients API](/docs/api/resources/oauth-clients.html#update-client-application) is not what you wish to use, you can change the value of a client app's `token_endpoint_auth_method` with any of the values returned by `token_endpoint_auth_methods_support` (`client_secret_post`, `client_secret_basic`, or `client_secret_jwt`).

You can't change this value in the Okta user interface.

##### Token Claims for Client Authentication with Client Secret JWT

If you use a JWT for client authentication (`client_secret_jwt`), use the following token claims:

| Token Claim | Description                                                                         | Type   |
|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
| exp         | Required. The expiration time of the token in seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.    | Long   |
| iat         | Optional. The issuing time of the token in seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.       | Long   |
| sub         | Required. The subject of the token. This value must be the same as the `client_id`. | String |
| aud         | Required. The full URL of the endpoint you're using the JWT to authenticate to.     | String |
| iss         | Required. The issuer of the token. This value must be the same as the `client_id`.  | String |
| jti         | Optional. The identifier of the token.                                              | String |

Parameter Details

* If `jti` is specified, the token can only be used once. So, for example, subsequent token requests won't succeed.
* The `exp` claim will fail the request if the expiration time is more than one hour in the future or has already expired.
* If `iat` is specified, then it must be a time before the request is received.


##### Response Parameters
{:.api .api-response .api-response-params}

Based on the grant type and in some cases scope specified in the request, the response contains different token sets.
Generally speaking, the scopes specified in a request are included in the Access Tokens in the response. 

| Requested grant type | Requested scope                                                            | Tokens in the response                                                                   |

#### Introspection Request
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation post /oauth2/*:authorizationServerId*/v1/introspect %}

The API takes an Access Token or Refresh Token, and returns a boolean indicating whether it is active or not.
If the token is active, additional data about the token is also returned. If the token is invalid, expired, or revoked, it is considered inactive.
An implicit client can only introspect its own tokens, while a confidential client may inspect all tokens.

>Note: ID Tokens are also valid, however, they are usually validated on the service provider or app side of a flow.

##### Request Parameters
{:.api .api-request .api-request-params}

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

#### Revoke a Token
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation post /oauth2/:authorizationServerId/v1/revoke %}

This API takes an Access Token or Refresh Token and revokes it. Revoked tokens are considered inactive at the introspection endpoint. A client can revoke only its own tokens.

##### Request Parameters
{:.api .api-request .api-request-params}

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Type   |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
| token                 | An access token or refresh token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | String |
| token_type_hint       | A hint of the type of `token`. Valid values are `access_token` and `refresh_token`.                                                                                                                                                                         | Enum   |
| client_id             | The client ID generated as a part of client registration. This is used in conjunction with the *client_secret* parameter to authenticate the client application.                                                                                            | String |
| client_secret         | Required if the client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header, and if `client_assertion_type` isn't specified. This client secret is used in conjunction with `client_id` to authenticate the client application. | String |
| client_assertion      | Required if the `client_assertion_type` is specified. Contains the JWT signed with the `client_secret`.     [JWT Details](#token-authentication-methods)                                                                                                        | String |
| client_assertion_type | Indicates a JWT is being used to authenticate the client. Per the     [Client Authentication spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication), the valid value is `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.     | String |

> Native applications should not provide -- and by default do not store -- `client_secret`
(see [Section 5.3.1 of the OAuth 2.0 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.3.1)).
They can omit `client_secret` from the above request parameters when revoking a token.

##### Response Parameters
{:.api .api-response .api-response-params}

A successful revocation is denoted by an empty response with an HTTP 200. Note that revoking an invalid expired, or revoked token is a success so information isn't leaked.

A client may only revoke a token generated for that client.

For more information about token authentication, see [Token Authentication Methods](#token-authentication-methods).

>Okta strongly recommends retrieving keys dynamically with the JWKS published in the discovery document.
It is safe to cache keys for performance.


Any of the keys listed are used to sign tokens. The order of keys in the result doesn't indicate which keys are used.

Standard open-source libraries are available for every major language to perform [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) signature validation.

* The listed `ACTIVE` key is used to sign tokens issued by the authorization server.
* The listed `NEXT` key is the next key that the authorization server will use to sign tokens when keys are rotated. The NEXT key might not be listed if it has not been generated yet.
* The listed `EXPIRED` key is the previous key that the authorization server used to sign tokens. The EXPIRED key might not be listed if no key has expired or the expired key has been deleted.

#### Rotate Authorization Server Keys
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation post /api/v1/authorizationServers/:authorizationServerId/credentials/lifecycle/keyRotate %}

Rotates the current keys for the Authorization Server. If you rotate keys, the `ACTIVE` key becomes the `EXPIRED` key, the `NEXT` key becomes the `ACTIVE` key, and the Authorization Server immediately issues tokens signed with the new active key.

>Authorization server keys can be rotated in both *MANUAL* and *AUTO* mode, however, it is recommended to rotate keys manually only when the authorization server is in *MANUAL* mode.
>If keys are rotated manually, any intermediate cache should be invalidated and keys should be fetched again using the [get keys](oauth2.html#get-keys) endpoint.

##### Request Parameters

## Troubleshooting for API Access Management

If you run into trouble setting up an authorization server or performing
other tasks for API Access Management, use the following suggestions to resolve your issues.

### Start with the System Log

The system log contains detailed information about why a request was denied and other useful information.

### Limits

* Scopes are unique per authorization server.

* The `audiences` value you specify is an array of String. If the string contains ":" it must be a valid URI.

* Tokens can expire, be explicitly revoked at the endpoint, or implicitly revoked by a change in configuration.

* Token revocation can be implicit in two ways: token expiration or a change to the source.
    * Expiration happens at different times:
        * ID Token expires after one hour.
        * Access Token expiration is configured in a policy, but is always between five minutes and one day.
        * Refresh Token expiration depends on two factors: 1) Expiration is configured in an Access Policy, no limits,
          but must be greater than or equal to the Access Token lifetime, and 2) Revocation if the Refresh Token
          isn't exercised within a specified time. Configure the specified time in an Access Policy, with a minimum of ten minutes.

    * Revocation happens when a configuration is changed or deleted:
        * User deactivation or deletion.
        * Configuration in the authorization server is changed or deleted.
        * The [client app](https://help.okta.com/en/prev/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm#OIDCWizard) is deactivated, changed, unassigned, or deleted.

### Subtle Behavior

Some behaviors aren't obvious:

* A user must be assigned to the client in Okta for the client to get Access Tokens from that client.
You can assign the client directly (direct user assignment) or indirectly (group assignment).

* If you haven't created a rule in a policy in the authorization server to allow the client, user, and
scope combination that you want, the request fails.
To resolve, create at least one rule in a policy in the authorization server for the relevant resource
that specifies client, user, and scope.

* OpenID Connect scopes are granted by default, so if you are requesting only those scopes ( `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`, or `offline_access` ), you don't need to define any scopes for them, but you need a policy and rule
in the Authorization Server. The rule grants the OpenID Connect scopes by default, so they don't need to be configured in the rule.
Token expiration times depend on how they are defined in the rules, and which policies and rules match the request.

* OpenID scopes can be requested with custom scopes. For example, a request can include `openid` and a custom scope.

* The evaluation of a policy always takes place during the initial authentication of the user (or of the client in case of client credentials flow). If the flow is not immediately finished, such as when a token is requested using `authorization_code` grant type, the policy is not evaluated again, and a change in the policy after the user or client is initially authenticated won't affect the continued flow.

##### Details for `groupFilterType`

If `valueType` is `GROUPS`, then the groups returned are filtered according to the value of `groupFilterType`:

* `STARTS_WITH`: Group names start with `value` (not case sensitive). For example, if `value` is `group1`, then `group123` and `Group123` are included.
* `EQUALS`: Group name is the same as `value` (not case sensitive). For example, if `value` is `group1`, then `group1` and `Group1` are included, but `group123` isn't.
* `CONTAINS`: Group names contain `value` (not case sensitive). For example, if `value` is `group1`, then `MyGroup123` and `group1` are included.
* `REGEX`: Group names match the REGEX expression in `value` (case sensitive). For example if `value` is `/^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/`, then any group name that has at least 3 letters, no more than 16, and contains lower case letters, a hyphen, or numbers. 

##### Details for `alwaysIncludeInToken`

* Always `TRUE` for Access Token
* If `FALSE` for an ID Token claim, the claim won't be included in the ID Token if ID token is requested with Access Token or `authorization_code`, instead the client has to use Access Token to get the claims from the UserInfo endpoint.
