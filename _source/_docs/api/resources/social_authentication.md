# Social Login

{% api_lifecycle ea %}

Okta allows your users to sign in to your app using their Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Microsoft credentials. Once the user has successfully authenticated, they are returned to your app, and their social profile information is pulled into your Okta directory.

### Features

Configuring social login with Okta allows you to use the following features:

* **User Registration:** Capture the Profile attributes from a Social Identity Provider user and store those attributes in Okta's Universal Directory.

* **User Authentication:** After a user is registered, continue to use that Social Identity Provider for user authentication, thus eliminating the need to store an additional username and password for that user.

* **Social Profile Sync:** If a user updates their Social Profile, those changes can be reflected inside Okta the next time they use social login.

* **Support for Multiple Social Profiles** Multiple Social Profiles can all be linked to one Okta user.

* **Support for Webhooks:** Make callouts to your application during user registration and/or account linking. For example: prompt a user for additional attributes before linking their account, or enable a customized validation or confirmation flow.

* **OAuth 2.0 Scope Configuration:** Specify OAuth 2.0 scopes to fully control which Social Profile attributes are linked to Okta. 

### The Social Login Process

The social login process starts at the auth point, then goes out to the provider and back:

1. The user who wishes to authenticate clicks a “Log in with x” link.
2. The user authenticates and is asked by the Provider to accept the permissions required by your app.
3. Once the user accepts the permissions, Okta handles the authentication and redirects the user back to your specified redirect URI.

### The Set-up Process

To set-up social login, you configure the following: 

1. An OAuth 2.0 client in your social provider
2. An Identity Provider in Okta
3. An OpenID Connect Application in Okta

Every Identity Provider in Okta is linked to an Application, and every time a user signs in with a Social Identity Provider for the first time, an Application User is created for them. The Application User represents the external user at the Social Identity Provider and can be used to map attributes to the Okta User. For more information about how to configure this behavior see [Social Identity Provider Settings](#social-idp-settings) below.


## Facebook

* **Client Id:** Paste in the App ID that you got from Facebook in step 1.5 above.
* **Client Secret:** Paste in the App Secret that you got from Facebook in step 1.5 above.
* **Scopes:** Leave set to the default.

> For more information about these, see [Social Identity Provider Settings](#social-idp-settings) below.

2.5. Once you have completed all the fields, click on **Add Identity Provider**. You will be returned to the main “Identity Providers” page. 

2.6. Find the Facebook Identity Provider that you just added. Once you have found the entry, copy both the “Authorize URL” and “Redirect URI” (ending in `/authorize/callback`).

##### 3. Add the Okta Redirect URI to Facebook

3.1. In your Facebook app configuration, select **Settings** in the left pane.

3.2. Choose **Add Platform**.

3.3. Choose **Website**.

3.4. In the Site URL field, enter the Okta "Redirect URI" that you copied in step 2.6.

3.5. Click **Save Changes**.

##### 4. Register an OpenID Connect Application in Okta

4.1. Back on the Okta Admin site, click on **Applications**.

4.2. Click **Add Application**.

4.3. On the “Add Application” page, click **Create New App**.

4.4. In the modal that pops up, select the appropriate platform for your use case and choose **OpenID Connect** as your sign-on method. 

4.5. Add a name of your choosing, and optionally a logo. 

4.6. Add one or more Redirect URIs. This is where the user will be directed to after they have authenticated with Facebook.

4.7. Click **Finish** and you will arrive on the page for your new application. 

4.8. Under "General Settings", check if the "Implicit (Hybrid)" grant type is enabled. If it is not already enabled, click **Edit**, enable it, and click **Save**.

4.10. Click on the **Assignments** tab.

4.11. Click **Assign** > **Assign to Groups**.

4.12. Assign the group that you chose under "Group Assignments" in Step 2.4 above. If you did not choose a Group, assign "Everyone", then click **Done**. 

##### 5. Complete Your Authorize URL

The Okta Identity Provider that you created in section 2 above generated an Authorize URL with a number of blank parameters that you must now fill-in:

* **client_id:** use the client_id value you copied in step 4.10.
* **scope:** Determines the claims that are returned in the ID token. This should have at least `openid`.
* **response_type:** Determines which flow is used. This should be `id_token`.
* **response_mode:** Determines how the authorization response should be returned. This should be `fragment`.
* **state:** Protects against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* **nonce:** A string included in the returned ID Token. Use it to associate a client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.
* **redirect_uri:** The location where Okta returns a browser after the user has finished authenticating against their social login provider. This URL must start with “https” and must match one of the Redirect URIs that you configured previously in step 4.6.

For a full explanation of all these parameters, see here: [OAuth 2.0 Request parameters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#request-parameters).

An example of a complete URL looks like this: `https://example.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?idp=0oaaq9pjc2ujmFZexample&client_id=GkGw4K49N4UEE1example&response_type=id_token&response_mode=fragment&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourAppUrlHere.com%2Fsocial_auth&state=WM6D&nonce=YsG76jo`

#### Using Facebook for Login

There are three primary ways to kick off the sign-in with Facebook flow.

**HTML Link**

One option is to create a link that the user clicks in order to log in. The HREF for that link would be the Authorize URL that you created previously:

`<a href=“https://example.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?idp=0oaaq9pjc2ujmFZexample&client_id=GkGw4K49N4UEE1example&response_type=id_token&response_mode=fragment&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourAppUrlHere.com%2Fsocial_auth&state=WM6D&nonce=YsG76jo”>Login With Facebook</a>`

After clicking this link, the user will be prompted to sign in with the social provider. After they succeed they will be returned to the specified `redirect_uri` along with an ID Token in JWT format.

**Okta Sign-in Widget**

Okta also offers an easily embeddable JavaScript widget that reproduces the look and behavior of the standard Okta sign-in page. Adding a "Login with Facebook" button is as simple as adding the following code to your configuration:

```js
idps: [
  {type: 'FACEBOOK', id: '$Your_FB_IDP_ID_Here'}
]
```

You can find out more about it [on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#okta-sign-in-widget). Implementing login with Facebook would use the Widget's [OpenID Connect authentication flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#openid-connect).

**Auth.js**

If you don't want pre-built views, or need deeper levels of customization, then you can use the same AuthJS SDK that the Sign-in Widget is built with. For further information see [the AuthJS GitHub repo](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#install). Implementing login with Facebook would use the SDK's [OpenID Connect authentication flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#openid-connect-options).

**HTML Link**

One option is to create a link that the user clicks in order to log in. The HREF for that link would be the Authorize URL that you created previously:

`<a href=“https://example.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?idp=0oaaq9pjc2ujmFZexample&client_id=GkGw4K49N4UEE1example&response_type=id_token&response_mode=fragment&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourAppUrlHere.com%2Fsocial_auth&state=WM6D&nonce=YsG76jo”>Login With Microsoft</a>`

After clicking this link, the user will be prompted to sign in with the social provider. After they succeed they will be returned to the specified `redirect_uri` along with an ID Token in JWT format.

**Okta Sign-in Widget**

Okta also offers an easily embeddable JavaScript widget that reproduces the look and behavior of the standard Okta sign-in page. You can find out more about it [on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#okta-sign-in-widget). Implementing login with Microsoft would use the Widget's [OpenID Connect authentication flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#openid-connect).

**Auth.js**

If you don't want pre-built views, or need deeper levels of customization, then you can use the same AuthJS SDK that the Sign-in Widget is built with. For further information see [the AuthJS GitHub repo](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#install). Implementing login with Microsoft would use the SDK's [OpenID Connect authentication flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#openid-connect-options).

# Social Identity Provider Settings <a name="social-idp-settings"></a>

When you are setting up your social Identity Provider (IdP) in Okta, there are a number of settings that allow you to finely control the social login behavior. While the provider-specific instructions show one possible configuration, this section explains each of these in more detail so that you can choose the right configuration for your use case.

### Authentication Settings

**IdP username:** This is the expression (written in the Okta Expression Language) that will be used to convert an IdP attribute to the Application User's `username`. This IdP username will be used for matching an Application User to an Okta User. 

For example, the value `idpuser.email` means that it takes the `email` attribute passed by the social IdP and maps it to the Okta Application User's `username` property.

You can enter an expression to reformat the value, if desired. For example, if the social username is `john.doe@mycompany.com`, you could specify the replacement of `mycompany` with `endpointA.mycompany` to make the transformed username `john.doe@endpointA.mycompany.com`. See here for more information about the [Okta Expression Language](http://developer.okta.com/docs/getting_started/okta_expression_lang.html).

**Match against:** The Okta user property against which the IdP username is compared. 

More user profile attributes are available for matching as an Early Access feature. To enable more choices, contact Support.

**Account Link Policy:** Determines whether your Application User should be linked to an Okta user.

* Automatic: Link user accounts automatically according to the "Auto-Link Restrictions" and "Match against" settings. 
* Callout: Account linking decisions should be delegated to an external application.
* Disabled: Do not link existing User accounts. Unless User is already linked, login will fail.

**Auto-Link Restrictions:** Allows you to restrict auto-linking to members of specified groups.

**Provisioning Policy:** Determines whether just-in-time provisioning of users should be automatic, disabled, or delegated to an external application via a callout.

### JIT Settings

**Profile Master:** If selected, the Social Identity Provider will be the source of truth for a user's profile attributes. This means that next time the user signs in using the Social Identity Provider, Okta will update the user profile attributes for this user. If a user is assigned multiple applications with profile mastering enabled, a prioritization in Directory -> Profile Masters will decide whether this provider will be mastering the user's attributes. For more information about this, see [Attribute Level Master](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Directory/Attribute_Level_Mastering.htm?Highlight=Attribute%20Level%20Mastering) 

**Group Assignments:** Allows you to assign new users to one or more existing Groups. For example, new Facebook users could be added to a "Facebook" Group.
