# OpenID Connect API

The OpenID Connect API endpoints enable clients to use [OIDC workflows](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) with Okta.
With OpenID Connect, a client can use Okta as a broker. The user authenticates against identity providers like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Microsoft,
and the client obtains an Okta session.

> This API is currently in **Early Access** status.  It has been tested as thoroughly as a Generally Available feature. Contact Support to enable this feature.

## Getting Started

If you are new to OpenID Connect, read this topic before experimenting with the Postman collection. If you are familiar with
[the OpenID Connect spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), you may want to experiment with the Postman collection now:

## Authentication Basics with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework for delegated access to APIs, and OpenID Connect is an SSO protocol for authenticating end-users and asserting their identity.
OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0:

* Provides a signed *id_token* for the client and a UserInfo endpoint from which you can fetch user attributes.
* Provides a standard set of scopes and claims for identities including profile, email, address, and phone.

{% img openID_overview.png alt:"OpenID Architecture Diagram" %}

Okta is the identity provider responsible for verifying the identity of users and applications that exist in an organization’s directory,
and issuing ID Tokens upon successful authentication of those users and applications.

The basic authentication flow with Okta as your identity provider:

1. The application sends a request to Okta.
2. Okta authenticates the client.
3. Okta authenticates the user.
4. Okta approves or denies the requested scopes.
5. Okta mints a token and sends it in the response.
6. The application validates the ID Token’s integrity. For more information, see [Validating ID Tokens](#validating-id-tokens).

> Important: Okta uses public key cryptography to sign tokens and verify that they are valid.
See the last section of [Validating ID Tokens](#validating-id-tokens) for more information on the necessary logic
you must have in your application to ensure it’s always updated with the latest keys.

The flow of requests and responses for the authentication process is based on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols.
The properties you need depend on which client profile and use case you are targeting.

## Claims

Tokens issued by Okta contain claims, which are statements about a subject (user).
For example, the claim can be about a name, identity, key, group, or privilege.
The claims in a security token are dependent upon the type of token, the type of credential used to authenticate the user, and the application configuration.

The claims requested by the `profile`, `email`, `address`, and `phone` scope values are returned from the UserInfo Endpoint, as described in [the OpenID spec Section 5.3.2](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoResponse), when a `response_type` value is used that results in an Access Token being issued. However, when no Access Token is issued (which is the case for the `response_type` value `id_token`), the resulting Claims are returned in the ID Token.

## Scopes

OpenID Connect uses scope values to specify what access privileges are being requested for Access Tokens.
The scopes associated with Access Tokens determine which claims are available when they are used
to access [the OIDC `userinfo` endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc.html#get-user-information). The following scopes are supported:

| -------------  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------                               | -------------- |
| Property       | Description                                                                                                   | Required       |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------|
| openid         | Identifies the request as an OpenID Connect request.                                                          | Yes            |
| profile        | Requests access to the end-user's default profile claims.                                                     | No             |
| email          | Requests access to the `email` and `email_verified` claims.                                                   | No             |
| phone          | Requests access to the `phone_number` and `phone_number_verified` claims.                                     | No             |
| address        | Requests access to the `address` claim.                                                                       | No             |
| groups         | Requests access to the `groups` claim.                                                                        | No             |
| offline_access | Requests a Refresh Token, used to obtain more access tokens without re-prompting the user for authentication. | No             |

### Scope Values

* `openid` is required for any OpenID request connect flow. If no openid scope value is present, the request may
  be a valid OAuth 2.0 request, but it's not an OpenID Connect request.
* `profile` requests access to these default profile claims: `name`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, `nickname`, `preferred_username`, `profile`,  
`picture`, `website`, `gender`, `birthdate`, `zoneinfo`,`locale`, and `updated_at`.
* `offline_access` can only be requested in combination with a `response_type` containing `code`. If the `response_type` does not contain `code`, `offline_access` will be ignored.
* For more information about `offline_access`, see the [OIDC spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess).

## ID Token

OpenID Connect introduces an [ID Token](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken)
which is a [JSON web token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) that contains information about an authentication event
and claims about the authenticated user that clients can rely on.

Clients can use any of the following sequences of operations to obtain an ID Token:
* [Authorization code flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) -- the client obtains
an authorization code from the authorization server's authentication endpoint and uses it to obtain an ID token and an access
token from the authorization server's Token endpoint.
* [Implicit flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth) -- the client obtains an ID
token and optionally an Access Token directly from the authorization server's authentication endpoint.
* [Hybrid flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) -- a combination of the other
two flows.

Clients should always [validate ID Tokens](#validating-id-tokens) to ensure their integrity.

The ID Tokens returned by the authentication endpoint (implicit flow) or the Token endpoint (authorization code flow)
are identical, except that in the implicit flow, the *nonce* parameter is required (and hence must have been included
in the request), and the *at_hash* parameter is required if the response includes an Access Token but prohibited if the
response does not include an Access Token.

The ID Token (*id_token*) consists of three period-separated, base64URL-encoded JSON segments: [a header](#id-token-header), [the payload](#id-token-payload), and [the signature](#id-token-signature).

Be aware of the following before you work with scope-dependent claims:

* To protect against arbitrarily large numbers of groups matching the group filter, the groups claim has a limit of 100.
If more than 100 groups match the filter, then the request fails. Expect that this limit may change in the future.
For more information about configuring an app for OpenID Connect, including group claims, see [Using OpenID Connect](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect).
* **Important:** Scope-dependent claims are returned differently depending on the values in `response_type` and the scopes requested:

    | Response Type             | Claims Returned in ID Token                                                                        | Claims Returned from the Userinfo Endpoint  |

    | `code` `id_token` `token` | `email` if email scope is requested; `name` and `preferred_username` if profile scope is requested | Claims associated with the requested scopes |

* The full set of claims for the requested scopes is available via the [/oauth2/v1/userinfo](#get-user-information) endpoint. Call this endpoint using the Access Token.

## Endpoints

Explore the OpenID Connect API: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/98b408c69b64c5de583e){:target="_blank"}

>The OIDC Access Token is applicable only for the Okta `/oauth2/v1/userinfo` endpoint and thus should be treated as opaque by the application. The application does not need to validate it since it should not be used against other resource servers. The format of it and the key used to sign it are subject to change without prior notice.

### Get User Information
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation get /oauth2/v1/userinfo %}
{% api_operation post /oauth2/v1/userinfo %}

You must include the `access_token` returned from the [/oauth2/v1/authorize](oidc.html#authentication-request) endpoint as an authorization header parameter.

This endpoint complies with the [OIDC userinfo spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

#### Request Example
{:.api .api-request .api-request-example}

~~~sh
curl -v -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
"https://${org}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo"
~~~

#### Response Parameters
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}

Returns a JSON document with information requested in the scopes list of the token.

#### Response Example (Success)
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}
~~~json
{
  "sub": "00uid4BxXw6I6TV4m0g3",
  "name" :"John Doe",
  "nickname":"Jimmy",
  "given_name":"John",
  "middle_name":"James",
  "family_name":"Doe",
  "profile":"http://profile.wordpress.com/john.doe",
  "zoneinfo":"America/Los_Angeles",
  "locale":"en-US",
  "updated_at":1311280970,
  "email":"john.doe@example.com",
  "email_verified":true,
  "address" : { "street_address": "123 Hollywood Blvd.", "locality": "Los Angeles", "region": "CA", "postal_code": "90210", "country": "US" },
  "phone_number":"+1 (425) 555-1212"
}
~~~

The claims in the response are identical to those returned for the requested scopes in the *id_token* JWT, except for the *sub* claim which is always present.
See [Scope-Dependent Claims](#scope-dependent-claims-not-always-returned) for more information about individual claims.

#### Validating ID Tokens

You can pass ID Tokens around different components of your app, and these components can use ID Tokens as a lightweight authentication mechanism identifying the app and the user.
But before you can use the information in the ID Token or rely on it as an assertion that the user has authenticated, you must validate it to prove its integrity.

ID Tokens are sensitive and can be misused if intercepted. Transmit them only over HTTPS
and only via POST data or within request headers. If you store them on your server, you must store them securely.

Clients must validate the ID Token in the Token Response in the following manner:

1. Verify that the *iss* (issuer) claim in the ID Token exactly matches the issuer identifier for your Okta org (which is typically obtained during [Discovery](#openid-connect-discovery-document).
2. Verify that the *aud* (audience) claim contains the *client_id* of your app.
3. Verify the signature of the ID Token according to [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) using the algorithm specified in the JWT *alg* header property. Use the public keys provided by Okta via the [Discovery Document](#openid-connect-discovery-document).
4. Verify that the expiry time (from the *exp* claim) has not already passed.
5. A *nonce* claim must be present and its value checked to verify that it is the same value as the one that was sent in the Authentication Request. The client should check the nonce value for replay attacks.
6. The client should check the *auth_time* claim value and request re-authentication using the *prompt=login* parameter if it determines too much time has elapsed since the last end-user authentication.

Step 3 involves downloading the public JWKS from Okta (specified by the *jwks_uri* property in the [discovery document](#openid-connect-discovery-document). The result of this call is a [JSON Web Key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) set.

Each public key is identified by a *kid* attribute, which corresponds with the *kid* claim in the [ID Token header](#claims-in-the-header-section).

Please note the following:

* For security purposes, Okta automatically rotates keys used to sign the token.
* The current key rotation schedule is four times a year. This schedule can change without notice.
* In case of an emergency, Okta can rotate keys as needed.
* Okta always publishes keys to the JWKS.
* If your app follows the best practice to always resolve the *kid*, key rotations won't cause problems.
* If you download the key and store it locally, **you are responsible for updates**.

>Keys used to sign tokens automatically rotate and should always be resolved dynamically against the published JWKS. Your app might fail if you hardcode public keys in your applications. Be sure to include key rollover in your implementation.

>If your application cannot retrieve keys dynamically, the administrator can disable the automatic key rotation in the administration UI, [generate a key credential](apps.html#generate-new-application-key-credential) and [update the application](apps.html#update-key-credential-for-application) to use it for signing.

### Introspection Request
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation post /oauth2/v1/introspect %}

The API takes an Access Token or Refresh Token, and returns a boolean indicating whether it is active or not.
If the token is active, additional data about the token is also returned. If the token is invalid, expired, or revoked, it is considered inactive.
An implicit client can only introspect its own tokens, while a confidential client can inspect all Access Tokens.

> Note; [ID Tokens](oidc.html#id-token) are also valid, however, they are usually validated on the service provider or app side of a flow.

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Type   |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
| token           | An Access Token, ID Token, or Refresh Token.                                                                                                                                                   | String |
| token_type_hint | A hint of the type of *token*.                                                                                                                                                                 | String |
| client_id       | Required if client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header. This is used in conjunction with `client_secret`  to authenticate the client application. | String |
| client_secret   | Required if the client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header. This is used in conjunction with `client_id` to authenticate the client application.  | String |

##### Token Authentication Methods

The client can authenticate by providing *client_id* and *client_secret* as a part of the URL-encoded form parameters (as described in table above),
or it can use basic authentication by providing the *client_id* and *client_secret* as an Authorization header using the Basic auth scheme.
Use one authentication mechanism with a given request. Using both returns an error.

For authentication with Basic auth, an HTTP header with the following format must be provided with the POST request.

~~~sh
Authorization: Basic ${Base64(<client_id>:<client_secret>)}
~~~

#### Response Parameters

Based on the type of token and whether it is active or not, the returned JSON contains a different set of information. Besides the claims in the token, the possible top-level members include:

### Revocation Request
{:.api .api-operation}


{% api_operation post /oauth2/v1/revoke %}

The API takes an Access Token or Refresh Token and revokes it. Revoked tokens are considered inactive at the introspection endpoint. A client may only revoke its own tokens.

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Type   |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
| token           | An Access Token or Refresh Token.                                                                                                                                | String |
| token_type_hint | A hint of the type of `token`.                                                                                                                                   | String |
| client_id       | The client ID generated as a part of client registration. This is used in conjunction with the `client_secret` parameter to authenticate the client application. | String |
| client_secret   | The client secret generated as a part of client registration. This is used in conjunction with the `client_id` parameter to authenticate the client application. | String |

##### Token Authentication Methods

A client may only revoke a token generated for that client.

The client can authenticate by providing *client_id* and *client_secret* as a part of the URL-encoded form parameters (as described in table above),
or it can use basic authentication by providing the *client_id* and *client_secret* as an Authorization header using the Basic auth scheme.
Use one authentication mechanism with a given request. Using both returns an error.

For authentication with Basic auth, an HTTP header with the following format must be provided with the POST request.

~~~sh
Authorization: Basic ${Base64(<client_id>:<client_secret>)}
~~~

#### Response Parameters

A successful revocation is denoted by an empty response with an HTTP 200. Note that revoking an invalid, expired, or revoked token will still be considered a success as to not leak information

#### List of Errors

>Okta strongly recommends retrieving keys dynamically with the JWKS published in the discovery document.
It is safe to cache or persist downloaded keys for performance.
However, if the client application is pinned to a signing key, the verification might fail since Okta rotates the key automatically.
Pinned client applications must periodically check the Okta signing keys.

Any of the two or three keys listed are used to sign tokens. The order of keys in the result doesn't indicate which keys are used.

Standard open-source libraries are available for every major language to perform [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) signature validation.

#### Alternative Validation

You can use an [introspection request](#introspection-request) for validation.

### Authentication Request
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation get /oauth2/v1/authorize %}

This is a starting point for OpenID Connect flows such as implicit and authorization code flows. This request
authenticates the user and returns tokens along with an authorization grant to the client application as a part
of the response.

#### Request Parameters
{:.api .api-request .api-request-params}

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Param Type | DataType | Required | Default          |

| sessionToken          | Okta one-time sessionToken. This allows an API-based user login flow (rather than Okta login UI). Session tokens can be obtained via the   [Authentication API](authn.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Query      | String   | FALSE    |                  |

#### Parameter Details

 * *idp* and *sessionToken* are Okta extensions to [the OpenID specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication).
    All other parameters comply with the OpenID Connect specification and their behavior is consistent with the specification.
 * Each value for *response_mode* delivers different behavior:
    * *fragment* -- Parameters are encoded in the URL fragment added to the *redirect_uri* when redirecting back to the client.
    * *query* -- Parameters are encoded in the query string added to the *redirect_uri* when redirecting back to the client.
    * *form_post* -- Parameters are encoded as HTML form values that are auto-submitted in the User Agent.Thus, the values are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the client
      and the result parameters are encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
    * *okta_post_message* -- Uses [HTML5 Web Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) (for example, window.postMessage()) instead of the redirect for the authorization response from the authentication endpoint.
      *okta_post_message* is an adaptation of the [Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00#section-4.1).
      This value provides a secure way for a single-page application to perform a sign-in flow
      in a popup window or an iFrame and receive the ID Token and/or access token back in the parent page without leaving the context of that page.
      The data model for the [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) call is in the next section.

 * Okta requires the OAuth 2.0 *state* parameter on all requests to the authentication endpoint in order to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
 The OAuth 2.0 specification [requires](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12) that clients protect their redirect URIs against CSRF by sending a value in the authorize request which binds the request to the user-agent's authenticated state.
 Using the *state* parameter is also a countermeasure to several other known attacks as outlined in [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819).

 * [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) (PKCE) is a stronger mechanism for binding the authorization code to the client than just a client secret, and prevents [a code interception attack](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#section-1) if both the code and the client credentials are intercepted (which can happen on mobile/native devices). The PKCE-enabled client creates a large random string as code_verifier and derives code_challenge from it using code_challenge_method. It passes the code_challenge and code_challenge_method in the authorization request for code flow. When a client tries to redeem the code, it must pass the code_verifer. Okta recomputes the challenge and returns the requested token only if it matches the code_challenge in the original authorization request. When a client, whose `token_endpoint_auth_method` is `none`, makes a code flow authorization request, the `code_challenge` parameter is required.

#### postMessage() Data Model

Use the postMessage() data model to help you when working with the *okta_post_message* value of the *response_mode* request parameter.

| error_description | Additional description of the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | String   |

*targetOrigin*:

Specifies what the origin of *parentWindow* must be in order for the postMessage() event to be dispatched
(this is enforced by the browser). The *okta-post-message* response mode always uses the origin from the *redirect_uri*
specified by the client. This is crucial to prevent the sensitive token data from being exposed to a malicious site.

#### Response Parameters

The method of returning the response depends on the response type passed to the API. For example, a *fragment* response mode returns values in the fragment portion of a redirect to the specified *redirect_uri* while a *form_post* response mode POSTs the return values to the redirect URI.
Irrespective of the response type, the contents of the response are as described in the table.

#### Request Examples

This request initiates the authorization code flow, as signaled by `response_type=code`. The request will return an authorization code that you can use as the `code` parameter in a token request.

~~~sh
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${org}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?
  client_id=${client_id}&
  response_type=code&
  response_mode=form_post&
  scope=openid offline_access&
  redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}&
  state=${state}&
  nonce=${nonce}"
~~~

This request initiates the implicit flow, that is, to obtain an ID Token and optionally an Access Token directly from the authorization server, use the same request,
but with `response_type=id_token` or `response_type=id_token token`:

~~~sh
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${org}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?
  client_id=${client_id}&
  response_type=id_token token&
  response_mode=form_post&
  scope=openid offline_access&
  redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}&
  state=${state}&
  nonce=${nonce}"
~~~

### Token Request
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation post /oauth2/v1/token %}

The API  returns Access Tokens, ID Tokens, and Refresh Tokens, depending on the request parameters. 

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Type   |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
| grant_type    | Can be one of the following: `authorization_code`, `password`, or `refresh_token`. Determines the mechanism Okta uses to authorize the creation of the tokens.                                                                                                                                                                    | String |
| code          | Required if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`. The value is what was returned from the   [authentication endpoint](#authentication-request).                                                                                                                                                                                     | String |
| refresh_token | Required if `grant_type` is `refresh_token`. The value is what was returned from this endpoint via a previous invocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | String |
| username      | Required if the grant_type is `password`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | String |
| password      | Required if the grant_type is `password`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | String |
| scope         | Required if `password` is the `grant_type`. This is a list of scopes that the client wants to be included in the Access Token. For the `refresh_token` grant type, these scopes have to be subset of the scopes used to generate the Refresh Token in the first place.                                                            | String |
| redirect_uri  | Required if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`. Specifies the callback location where the authorization was sent. This value must match the `redirect_uri` used to generate the original `authorization_code`.                                                                                                                  | String |
| code_verifier | Required if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`  and `code_challenge` was specified in the original `/authorize` request. This value is the code verifier for                 [PKCE](#parameter-details). Okta uses it to recompute the `code_challenge` and verify if it matches the original `code_challenge` in the authorization request.         | String |
| client_id     | Required if client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header. This is used in conjunction with `client_secret`  to authenticate the client application.                                                                                                                                    | String |
| client_secret | Required if the client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header. This is used in conjunction with `client_id` to authenticate the client application.                                                                                                                                     | String |

##### Refresh Tokens for Web and Native Applications

For web and native application types, an additional process is required:

1. Use the Okta Administration UI and check the **Refresh Token** checkbox under **Allowed Grant Types** on the client application page.
2. Pass the `offline_access` scope to your `/authorize` or `/token` request if you're using the `password` grant type.

##### Token Authentication Method

If you authenticate a client with client credentials, provide the [`client_id`](oidc.html#request-parameters)
and [`client_secret`](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect) using either of the following methods:

* In an Authorization header in the Basic auth scheme (basic authentication)
* As additional parameters to the POST body.

Including these credentials in both the Authorization header and POST body is not allowed.

For authentication with Basic auth, an HTTP header with the following format must be provided with the POST request.

~~~sh
Authorization: Basic ${Base64(<client_id>:<client_secret>)}
~~~

>If the value returned by `token_endpoint_authentication` in the [OAuth 2.0 Clients API](/docs/api/resources/oauth-clients.html#update-client-application) is not what you wish to use, you can change the value of a client app's `token_endpoint_authentication` with any of the values returned by `token_endpoint_auth_methods_support` (`client_secret_post` or `client_secret_basic`).
You can't change this value in the Okta user interface.

#### Response Parameters

Based on the `grant_type` and sometimes `scope`, the response contains different token sets.
Generally speaking, the scopes specified in a request are included in the Access Tokens in the response.

### Logout Request
{:.api .api-operation}

{% api_operation post /oauth2/v1/logout %}

The API takes an ID Token and logs the user out of Okta if the subject matches the current Okta session. A `post_logout_redirect_uri` may be specified to redirect the User after the logout has been performed. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the Okta login page.

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.
