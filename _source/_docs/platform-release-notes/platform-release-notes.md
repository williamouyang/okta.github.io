## Release 2017.16

### Advance Notice: API Rate Limit Improvements

We are making org-wide rate limits more granular, and treating authenticated end-user interactions separately. More granular rate limits will further lessen the likelihood of calls to one URI impacting another. Treating authenticated end-user interactions separately will lessen the chances of one user's impacting another. We’re also providing a transition period so you can see what these changes will look like in your Okta system log before enforcing them:

1. After Monday, 2017-04-17, you'll see system log alerts that let you know if you would have exceeded any of the new API rate limits. We're making this feature available to all preview orgs, and the feature will remain in preview for at least two weeks.

2. Starting later in April, 2017, we’ll treat authenticated end-user interactions on a per-user basis. Interactions like SSO after login won't apply to your org-wide API rate limits.

3. Early in May, 2017, we will enforce the new, more granular rate limits. At that point, the warnings in the System Log will change to error notifications.

Of course, as each change is released, we'll announce the change here.

For a full description of the rate limit changes, see [API Rate Limit Improvements](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/API-Rate-Limit-Improvements).<!-- OKTA-110472 -->

### Platform Feature Improvement: Zones API Generally Available in Preview

Access policies can now be defined based on an IP address range using [the Zones API](/docs/api/resources/zones.html).
This feature is Generally Available in preview orgs for at least one month before being Generally Available in production. <!-- OKTA-121280 -->

### Platform Bugs Fixed

 * When a group was deleted, if that group was referenced by a social or SAML IdP, the reference wasn't removed.
    These references caused errors when trying to configure the social or SAML IdP. (OKTA-116909)
 * If the SAML IdP parameter `idp` was specified in the query string for a request to the `oauth2/v1/authorize` endpoint, the request failed in some orgs. (OKTA-120122)
 * Creating or saving access policies for an authorization server failed for some client IDs. (OKTA-121230)
