#### Default Custom Authorization Server
<!-- OKTA-133786 -->

Okta provides a pre-configured custom authorization server named `default`.
This default authorization server includes a basic access policy and rule, which you can edit to control access.
It allows you to specify `default` instead of the `authorizationServerId` in requests to it:

* `https://{YourOktaOrg}}/api/v1/authorizationServers/default`  vs
* `https://{YourOktaOrg}}/api/v1/authorizationServers/:authorizationServerId` for other Customer Authorization Servers

#### Web App Supports Client Credential Grant Type
<!-- OKTA-102062 -->

You can now [configure the `web` application type to use a `client_credential` grant type](/docs/api/resources/oauth-clients.html#client-application-properties).
This allows you to use one `client_id` for an application that needs to make user-specific calls and back-end calls for data.

#### OpenID Connect Group Claim Retrieves Application Groups
<!-- OKTA_132193 -->

OpenID Connect, which uses the Okta Authorization Server, now supports the use of the Okta Expression Language [`getFilteredGroups` function](/reference/okta_expression_language/index.html#group-functions) to retrieve [application groups](/docs/api/resources/apps.html#application-group-model) for use in tokens.
Previously it only supported application groups in the Custom Authorization Server.  

#### SHA-256 Signed Certificates for New SAML 2.0 Apps

All new SAML 2.0 apps are bootstrapped with SHA-256 signed public certificates. Existing SAML 2.0 apps are unchanged.

### Platform Bug Fixes

Bug fixes are expected on preview orgs starting August 9, 2017, and on production orgs starting August 14, 2017.

* The **Add policy** button wasn't disabled for Org Admins, who don't have permission to create authorization server policies. (OKTA-127450)
* Some requests to `/oauth2/v1/authorize` with the `state` parameter incorrectly returned an error. (OKTA-130916)
* When an ID token was minted for a custom authorization server from a request to `/oauth2/:authorizationServerId/v1/token`, an app sign-on event wasn't generated. (OKTA-134554)

### Does Your Org Have This Change Yet?

To verify the current release for an org, click the **Admin** button and check the footer of the Dashboard page.
