## What Is a Refresh Token?

A refresh token is a special token that is used to generate additional access tokens. This allows you to have short-lived access tokens without having to collect credentials every single time one expires. Normally you would request this token alongside the access and/or ID tokens as part of a user's initial authentication flow.

## Setting Up Your Application

Refresh tokens are available for a subset of Okta OAuth 2.0 Client Applications, specifically `web` or `native` applications. For more about creating an OAuth 2.0 application see [Using the App Integration Wizard](https://help.okta.com/en/prev/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm).

Once you have an application, you need to make sure that the "Allowed grant types" include "Refresh Token". 

## How to Get a Refresh Token

To get a refresh token, you send a request to your Okta Authorization Server. 

In the case of the Authorization Code or Implicit flows, you use the Authorization Server's `/authorize` endpoint to get an authorization code, specifying an `offline_access` scope. You then send this code to the `/token` endpoint to get an access token and a refresh token. For more information about this endpoint, see [Obtain an Authorization Grant from a User](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#obtain-an-authorization-grant-from-a-user). For more information about the Authorization Code and Implicit flows, see: (jakub.todo)

For the Client Credentials and Resource Owner Password flows, you use the Authorization Server's `/token` endpoint directly. For more information about this endpoint, see [Request a Token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#request-a-token). For more information about the Client Credentials and Resource Owner Password flows, see: (jakub.todo)

The following combinations of grant type and scope, when sent to `/token` endpoint, will return a refresh token:

|Grant Type  | Scope |
|-------------|-------|
| `authorization_code`  | `offline_access`*  |
| `refresh_token`  | `offline_access` |
| `password`  | `offline_access`  |

> NOTE: The authorization code flow is unique, in that the `offline_access` scope has to be requested as part of the code request to the `/authorize` endpoint, and not the request sent to the `/token` endpoint.

This table only shows the minimum requirements. For example, with the `password` grant type you can also include an `openid` scope alongside the `offline_scope`:

```
'grant_type=password&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&username=example%40mailinator.com&password=a.gReAt.pasSword&scope=openid%20offline_access'
```

You would then get back an ID token alongside your access and refresh tokens.

> NOTE: Although you requested access, refresh, and ID tokens, the refresh token can only be used to get a new access token. An ID token will not be returned.

For more information see the [Okta OAuth 2.0 reference page](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#response-parameters-1).

## Get a Refresh Token Silently for Your SPA

In a normal Single-Page Application (SPA) you would likely want to use the Implicit flow (jakub.todo.see here for more on that)

What prompt=none is saying is that you want to prevent the login screen from showing up regardless of the whether the user has session or not. Either they do have a session, in which case you get tokens back, or they don't have a session in which case you get a nice silent error that you can then act on.

To perform silent authentication, you send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint with a `prompt` parameter value of `none`.

check -> success -> tokens (without the user knowing)
check -> error -> oh snap, i need them to reauthorize to get tokens
so you redirect

## How to Use a Refresh Token

To refresh your access token, you send a token request with a `grant_type` of `refresh_token`.

```
http --form POST https://dev-144769.oktapreview.com/oauth2/ausaw8fz3q4Yd3Zk70h7/v1/token \
  accept:application/json \
  authorization:'Basic MG9hYmg3M...' \
  cache-control:no-cache \
  content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded \
  postman-token:b20452fd-779c-9350-9344-28be9c1b9731 \
  grant_type=refresh_token \
  redirect_uri=http://localhost \
  scope=offline_access \
  refresh_token=MIOf-U1zQbyfa3MUfJHhvnUqIut9ClH0xjlDXGJAyqo
```

If the refresh token is valid, then you get back a new access/refresh token combination:

```
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJ[...]K1Sun9bA",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "scope": "offline_access",
    "refresh_token": "MIOf-U1zQbyfa3MUfJHhvnUqIut9ClH0xjlDXGJAyqo"
}
```
