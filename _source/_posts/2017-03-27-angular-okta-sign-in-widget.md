AngularJS reigned as king of JavaScript MVC frameworks for several years. However, when the Angular team announced they would not provide backwards compatibility for their next version, there was a bit of a stir in its community, giving opportunities for frameworks like React and Vue.js to flourish. Fast forward a few years and both Angular 2 and Angular 4 have been released. Many developers are trying its TypeScript and finding the experience a pleasant one. [According to JAXenter](https://jaxenter.com/technology-trends-2017-top-frameworks-131993.html), it’s doing a pretty good job, and holding strong as the third most popular UI framework, behind React and HTML5.

In this article, I’ll show you a quick way to get started with Angular, and add user authentication with [Okta's Sign-In Widget](/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget). If you’re just getting started with Angular, you might want to read my [Angular tutorial](http://gist.asciidoctor.org/?github-mraible/ng-demo//README.adoc). If you’d like to get the source code used in this article, you can [find it on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-sign-in-widget-example).

## Why User Authentication with Okta?

Okta provides an API service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. We make user account management easier, more secure, and scalable so you can get to production sooner.

The [Okta Sign-in Widget](/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget_ref) provides an embeddable JavaScript sign-in implementation that can be easily customized. The Sign-in Widget carries the same feature set in the standard Okta sign-in page of every tenant – with the added flexibility to change the look-and-feel. Included in the widget is support for password reset, forgotten password and strong authentication – all of which are driven by policies configured in Okta. Developers don’t have to write a single line of code to trigger these functions from within the widget. For consumer facing sites, social providers are also supported in the widget.

## Create an Angular Application

Angular 4 was [recently released](http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html), as well as [Angular CLI 1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100-2017-03-24). To see how you might use Okta's Sign-In Widget in a simple Angular application, create a new application with Angular CLI. First, you’ll need to install Angular CLI.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After this command completes, you can create a new application.

``` bash
[mraible:~] $ ng new angular-okta-example
installing ng
  create .editorconfig
  create README.md
  create src/app/app.component.css
  create src/app/app.component.html
  create src/app/app.component.spec.ts
  create src/app/app.component.ts
  create src/app/app.module.ts
  create src/assets/.gitkeep
  create src/environments/environment.prod.ts
  create src/environments/environment.ts
  create src/favicon.ico
  create src/index.html
  create src/main.ts
  create src/polyfills.ts
  create src/styles.css
  create src/test.ts
  create src/tsconfig.app.json
  create src/tsconfig.spec.json
  create src/typings.d.ts
  create .angular-cli.json
  create e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts
  create e2e/app.po.ts
  create e2e/tsconfig.e2e.json
  create .gitignore
  create karma.conf.js
  create package.json
  create protractor.conf.js
  create tsconfig.json
  create tslint.json
Successfully initialized git.
Installing packages for tooling via npm.
Installed packages for tooling via npm.
You can `ng set --global packageManager=yarn`.
Project 'angular-okta-example' successfully created.
[mraible:~] 1m40s $
```

This will create a new `angular-okta-example` directory and install all the necessary dependencies. To verify everything works, run `ng e2e` in a terminal window. All tests should pass and you should see results like the following.

## Integrate Okta’s Sign-In Widget in Angular

Now we’re going to leverage Okta’s Sign-In Widget for an easily customizable login view. To start, install the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget) using npm. Note that [using Yarn won't work](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/191).

```bash
npm install --save @okta/okta-signin-widget
```

Add the widget's CSS to `src/styles.css`:

```css
@import '~@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css';
@import '~@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-theme.css';
```

Add the widget's JavaScript file to `.angular-cli.json`:

```json
"scripts": [
  "../node_modules/@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/js/okta-sign-in.min.js"
],
```

Create `src/app/shared/okta/okta.service.ts` and use it to wrap the widget's configuration and make it an injectable service.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
declare let OktaSignIn: any;

@Injectable()
export class Okta {
  widget;

  constructor() {
    this.widget = new OktaSignIn({
      baseUrl: 'https://dev-{YOUR-ID}.oktapreview.com',
      clientId: '{CLIENT_ID}',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200'
    });
  }

  getWidget() {
    return this.widget;
  }
}
```

To make this service available to all components in the application, modify `app.module.ts` and list `Okta` as a provider.

```ts
import { Okta } from './shared/okta/okta.service';

@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [Okta],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
```

_Thanks to [Nic Raboy](https://twitter.com/nraboy) for teaching me that it's pretty easy to [include JavaScript libraries in a TypeScript application](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/javascript-libraries-in-a-typescript-application-revisited/). The key is the `declare` statement in the code above._

Before this will work, you'll need to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application in Okta so you can replace the `{YOUR_ID}` and `{CLIENT_ID}` references when initializing the widget.

## Create an OpenID Connect App in Okta

OpenID Connect is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user and, as well as to obtain their basic profile information. To learn more, see http://openid.net/connect/.

Login to your Okta account, or create one at [https://developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com) if you don't have one. Navigate to **Admin > Add Applications** and click on the **Create New App** button. Select **Single Page App (SPA)** for the Platform and **OpenID Connect** for the sign on method. Click the **Create** button and give your application a name. On the next screen, add **http://localhost:4200** as a Redirect URI and click **Finish**. You should see settings like the following.

{% img blog/angular-sign-in-widget/oidc-settings.png alt:"OIDC App Settings" width:"800" %}

Click on the **People** tab and the **Assign to People** button. Assign yourself as a user, or someone else that you know the credentials for.

## Show the Sign-In Widget

After making these changes, copy the your Client ID and Platform ID into `okta.service.ts`. Then modify `app.component.ts` to use the `Okta` service and the widget to login/logout.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Okta } from './shared/okta/okta.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'app works!';
  user;
  oktaSignIn;

  constructor(private okta: Okta) {
    this.oktaSignIn = okta.getWidget();
  }

  showLogin() {
    this.oktaSignIn.renderEl({el: '#okta-login-container'}, (response) => {
      if (response.status === 'SUCCESS') {
        this.user = response.claims.email;
      }
    });
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.oktaSignIn.session.get((response) => {
      if (response.status !== 'INACTIVE') {
        this.user = response.login
      } else {
        this.showLogin();
      }
    });
  }

  logout() {
    this.oktaSignIn.signOut(() => {
      this.showLogin();
      this.user = undefined;
    });
  }
}
```

And modify `app.component.html` to have a `<div>` with `id="okta-login-container"` and a place to show the logged in user's email.

{% raw %}
```html
<div *ngIf="!user" id="okta-login-container"></div>

<div *ngIf="user">
  Hello {{user}}

  <button (click)="logout()">Logout</button>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

Run `ng serve`, and open your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see the sign-in widget.

{% img blog/angular-sign-in-widget/sign-in-widget.png alt:"Sign-In Widget" width:"800" %}

However, if you look at your browser's console, you'll likely see an error:

```
XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://dev-158606.oktapreview.com/api/v1/sessions/me. Response to
preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:4200' is therefore not allowed access.
```

This happens when Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not enabled. To enable it, go to your Okta Admin Dashboard,
select **API** > **Trusted Origins**. Click the "Add Origin" button and specify `http://localhost:4200`
as the Origin URL with Type `CORS`. For more specific instructions, see Okta's [Enabling CORS documentation](/docs/api/getting_started/enabling_cors.html).

{% img blog/angular-sign-in-widget/cors-configuration.png alt:"CORS Configuration" width:"800" %}

After making this change, enter an assigned person's credentials to login. You should see a "Hello {email}" message with a logout button.

{% img blog/angular-sign-in-widget/login-success.png alt:"Login Success" width:"800" %}

**NOTE:** You may experience an issue where the sign-in process seems to hang. Clicking anywhere in the browser window seems to solve this problem. I’m not sure why.

If it works - congrats! If it doesn't, please post a question to Stack Overflow with an [okta tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta), or hit me up [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mraible).

### Known Issues

There are a couple of known issues in this tutorial. The first is that the widget's CSS takes over the whole page and will override your app's CSS. This is a [documented issue](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/126) and you can see [my comment on it](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/126#issuecomment-286530056) to learn more.

The other issue is that clicking the **Logout** button doesn't re-render the Sign-In Widget. You can do a `location.reload()` after logging out, but I'm guessing there's a better way.

To workaround the first issue, you can remove the global CSS files from `styles.css` and add CSS that only affects the widget.

#### Customize the Widget CSS

Remove the CSS `@import` statements to added to `src/styles.css`. Add an `@import` for [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and a few style rules to position elements. Copy the following code into `src/styles.css`.

```css
@import url(https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.6/css/bootstrap.min.css);

#okta-login-container {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 400px;
  border: 1px solid silver;
  padding: 20px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0 silver;
}

#okta-login-container input {
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 5px;
}

#okta-login-container input[type=checkbox] {
  width: 25px;
}
```

After making these changes, the sign-in widget will look like the following screenshot.

## Fix Your Tests
If you try to run `npm test` or `ng test`, tests will fail:

```bash
Chrome 56.0.2924 (Mac OS X 10.11.6): Executed 3 of 3 (3 FAILED) (0 secs / 0.181 secs)
Chrome 56.0.2924 (Mac OS X 10.11.6) AppComponent should render title in a h1 tag FAILED
	Failed: No provider for Okta!
```

To fix this, specify `Okta` as a provider in `src/app/app.component.spec.ts`.

```ts
import { Okta } from './shared/okta/okta.service';

describe('AppComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [
        AppComponent
      ],
      providers: [Okta]
    }).compileComponents();
  }));

```

After making this changes, you should see the sweet smell of success.

```bash
Chrome 56.0.2924 (Mac OS X 10.11.6): Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (8.562 secs / 7.479 secs)
```

Protractor tests should still work as well. You can prove this by running `ng e2e` in a terminal window.

## Angular + Okta

You can find a completed version of the application created in this blog post [on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-sign-in-widget-example). In a future post, I’ll show you how to create a more Angular-native experience, where you control the HTML for the login form.

Building authentication in an application is hard. It’s even less fun to build it over and over again in each application you build. Okta does the hard part for you and makes it a lot more fun to be a developer! [Sign up for a forever-free developer account and try Okta today!](https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/).

I hope you’ve enjoyed this quick tour of our Angular support. If you have questions about Okta’s features, or what we’re building next, please hit me up [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mraible), [post a question to Stack Overflow with an “okta” tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta), or [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-sign-in-widget-example/issues/new).
