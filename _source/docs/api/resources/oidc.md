# Overview

The OpenID Connect API endpoints enable clients to use [OIDC workflows](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) with Okta.
With OpenID Connect, a client can use Okta as a broker. The user authenticates against identity providers like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Microsoft,
and the client obtains an Okta session.

> This API is currently in **Early Access** status.  It has been tested as thoroughly as a Generally Available feature. Contact Support to enable this feature.

## Authentication Basics with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0:
 
* Provides a signed `id_token` for the client and a UserInfo endpoint from which you can fetch user attributes.
* Provides a standard set of scopes and claims for identities including profile, email, address, and phone.
* Suppolies built-in registration, discovery, and metadata for dynamic federations.
* Supports enterprise use with high assurance levels and workflows for key SAML use cases.

NOTE: illustration needs clean-up, but is it useful here? If not, what do we want?

![OpenID Architecture Diagram](/assets/img/openID_overview.png)

Think of OAuth 2.0 as an authorization framework for delegeated access to APIs, and OpenID Connect as an extension for authentication scenarios.

## OpenID Connect Workflows

OpenID Connect provides three basic workflows:

* [Implicit flow](implicit-flow)
* [Authorization code flow](authorization-code-flow)
* [Hybrid flow](hybrid-flow)

These flows don't necessarily map one-to-one with the different flows available in Okta. 
By understanding the underlying flows, you can choose the right flow for your goals.
 
### Implicit Flow 

Implicit flow is the simplest, and is most often used for web apps including single-page apps (SPAs), because no 
authorization code is returned. Implicit flow doesn't verify that the requesting client is the authenticated client.
You can't refresh the tokens, so implicit flow is not ideal for mobile device apps.

Implicit flow is also called a two-legged flow:

1. A client sends an authentication request from a browser app's sign-in page.
2. The request is redirected to Okta's authorization endpoint `/outh2/v1/authorize` and evaluated. 
3. If authorization is successful, Okta returns an `id_token` and an access token (if requested).

NOTE: image illustrating the steps here

NOTE: Following is the full flow from the spec. Do we need to talk about AS, or is the shorter description above okay?? 

1. Client prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.
2. Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
3. Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.
4. Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
5. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with an ID Token and, if requested, an Access Token.
6. Client validates the ID token and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.

For example, assume that a movie-industry newspaper wanted to make a SPA available to its subscribers, so
they can search for unproduced scripts. Users navigate to a sign-in page and
enter their credentials, and the sign-in page sends a request to Okta's endpoint for evaluation. Upon successful authentication,
Okta sends an `id_token` and access token to the newspaper's server, which then serves the single-page app to the browser.

### Authorization Code Flow

Authorization code flow verifies that the requesting client is the authenticated client.
Instead of receiving an `id_token`, the authorization code flow returns an authorization code, which can be
exchanged for an access token. This is also called a three-legged flow:

1. A client sends an authentication request with request parameters.
2. The request is redirected to Okta's authorization endpoint `/outh2/v1/authorize` and evaluated. 
3. If authorization is successful, Okta returns an `id_token` and an access token in the response body.
4. The client validates the `id_token` and exchanges the access token for the end user's subject identifier (???).

NOTE: The following image--what needs to change? Besides the Azure AD, obviously.

![Web App to Web API Diagram](/assets/img/app_to_api.png)

NOTE: Following is the full flow from the spec. Does any of it need to be added? I didn't follow the End-User Consent/Authorization part.

1. Client prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.
2. Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
3. Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.
4. Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
5. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with an Authorization Code.
6. Client requests a response using the Authorization Code at the Token Endpoint.
7. Client receives a response that contains an ID Token and Access Token in the response body.
8. Client validates the ID token and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.

Example: NOTE: need help with this example.

### Hybrid Flow

Hybrid flow is similar to authorization code flow, but includes additional response type parameters. It can therefore [????].

1. A client sends an authentication request with request parameters.
2. The request is redirected to Okta's authorization endpoint `/outh2/v1/authorize` and evaluated. 
3. If authorization is successful, Okta returns an `id_token`. 

NOTE: image illustrating the flow here

NOTE: Following is the full flow from the spec. Do I need to include anything? 

1. Client prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.
2. Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
3. Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.
4. Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
5. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with an Authorization Code and, depending on the Response Type, one or more additional parameters.
6. Client requests a response using the Authorization Code at the Token Endpoint.
7. Client receives a response that contains an ID Token and Access Token in the response body.
8. Client validates the ID Token and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.

Example: NOTE: need help with this example.

Example: There are a lot of app types in Okta. What about SWA? template apps? SAML apps? 

### Which Flow?

Use the flow that corresponds to the type of app you're authenticating and the goals of the authentication:

NOTE: Table Here from spec (http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication)?

* Web apps including single page application (SPA): Use implicit flow because you can't protect from man-in-the-middle
attacks (you can't keep client secrets secure), and you don't need to refresh any tokens.
* Web Server Application: Use authorization code flow so you can safely verify the client is the authenticated client.
Because the authorization code isn't useful until it's exchanged for a token, there's no vulnerability to a man-in-the-middle attack.
* Native Applications (desktops, mobile devices, or tablets): Use hybrid flow, because you need the ability to refresh tokens, you can keep client secrets secure,
and a client ID is needed to verify that the client is the authenticated client.

NOTE: What's the difference between a web applciation and a web server application? 
NOTE: If we want more of the details from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-scenarios/, I'll need someone to
help me sort out all the vocab differences between OIDC, Okta, and MSFT. 

## ID Token

OpenID Connect introduces an [ID Token](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) 
which is a [JSON web token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) that contains information about an authentication event 
as well as claims about the authenticated user.

ID Tokens should always be [validated](#validating-id-tokens) by the client to ensure their integrity.

The ID Token (`id_token`) consists of three period-separated, base64URL-encoded JSON segments: [a header](#header), [the payload](#payload), and [the signature](#signature). 

### Header

Be aware of the following before you work with scope-dependent claims:

* The client can also optionally request an Access Token along with the ID Token. In this case, in order to keep the size of the ID Token small, the ID Token body does not contain all the scope dependent claims. 
Instead, the ID token contains the `name` and `preferred_username` claims if the `profile` scope was requested and `email` claim if the `email` scope was requested.

* The full set of claims for the requested scopes is available via the [/oauth2/v1/userinfo](#get-user-information) endpoint. Call this endpoint using the Access Token.

* To protect against arbitrarily large numbers of groups matching the group filter, the group claim has a limit of 100. 
If more than 100 groups match the filter, then the request fails. Expect that this limit may change in the future.
For more information about configuring an app for OpenID Connect, including group claims, see [Using OpenID Connect](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-OpenID-Connect).


## Endpoints

Both the Access Token and the ID Token are acquired via [OAuth 2.0](oauth2.html) endpoints.

>The OIDC Access Token is applicable only for the Okta /oauth2/v1/userinfo endpoint and thus should be treated as opaque by the application. The application does not need to validate it since it should not be used against other resource servers. The format of it and the key used to sign it are subject to change without prior notice.

### Get User Information
{:.api .api-operation}

<span class="api-uri-template api-uri-get"><span class="api-label">GET, POST</span> /oauth2/v1/userinfo</span>

You must include the `access_token` returned from the [/oauth2/v1/authorize](oauth2.html#authentication-request) endpoint as an authorization header parameter.

This endpoint complies with the [OIDC userinfo spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

#### Request Example
{:.api .api-request .api-request-example}

~~~sh
curl -v -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
"https://${org}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo"
~~~

#### Response Parameters
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}

Returns a JSON document with information requested in the scopes list of the token.

#### Response Example (Success)
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}

}
~~~

The claims in the response are identical to those returned for the requested scopes in the `id_token` JWT, except for the sub-claim which is always present. 
See [Scope-Dependent Claims](#scope-dependent-claims-not-always-returned) for more information about individual claims.

#### Validating ID Tokens

You can pass ID Tokens around different components of your app, and these components can use it as a lightweight authentication mechanism identifying the app and the user.
But before you can use the information in the ID Token or rely on it as an assertion that the user has authenticated, you must validate it to prove its integrity.

ID Tokens are sensitive and can be misused if intercepted. Transmit them only over HTTPS
and only via POST data or within request headers. If you store them on your server, you must store them securely.

Clients must validate the ID Token in the Token Response in the following manner:

1. Verify that the `iss` (issuer) claim in the ID Token exactly matches the issuer identifier for your Okta org (which is typically obtained during [Discovery](#openid-connect-discovery-document). 
2. Verify that the `aud` (audience) claim contains the `client_id` of your app.
3. Verify the signature of the ID Token according to [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) using the algorithm specified in the JWT `alg` header parameter. Use the public keys provided by Okta via the [Discovery Document](#openid-connect-discovery-document).
4. Verify that the expiry time (from the `exp` claim) has not already passed.
5. A `nonce` claim must be present and its value checked to verify that it is the same value as the one that was sent in the Authentication Request. The client should check the nonce value for replay attacks.
6. The client should check the `auth_time` claim value and request re-authentication using the `prompt=login` parameter if it determines too much time has elapsed since the last end-user authentication.

Step 3 involves downloading the public JWKS from Okta (specified by the `jwks_uri` attribute in the [discovery document](#openid-connect-discovery-document). The result of this call is a [JSON Web Key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) set.

Each public key is identified by a `kid` attribute, which corresponds with the `kid` claim in the [ID Token header](#claims-in-the-header-section).

The ID Token is signed by an RSA private key. Okta publishes the corresponding public key and adds a public-key identifier `kid` in the ID Token header. To minimize the effects of key rotation, your application should check the `kid`, and if it has changed, check the `jwks_uri` value in the [well-known configuration](#openid-connect-discovery-document) for a new public key and `kid`.

All apps must roll over keys for adequate security. Please note the following:

* For security purposes, Okta automatically rotates keys used to sign the token.
* The current key rotation schedule is at least twice a year. This schedule can change without notice.
* In case of an emergency, Okta can rotate keys as needed.
* Okta always publishes keys to the JWKS.
* If your app follows the best practice to always resolve the `kid`, key rotations will not cause problems.
* If you download the key and store it locally, **you are responsible for updates**.

>Keys used to sign tokens automatically rotate and should always be resolved dynamically against the published JWKS. Your app might break if you hardcode public keys in your applications! Be sure to include key rollover in your implementation.

>If your application cannot retrieve keys dynamically, the administrator can disable the automatic key rotation in the administration UI, [generate a key credential](apps.html#generate-new-application-key-credential) and [update the application](apps.html#update-key-credential-for-application) to use it for signing.

### Get Keys
{:.api .api-operation}

<span class="api-uri-template api-uri-get"><span class="api-label">GET</span> /oauth2/v1/keys</span>

If automatic key rotation is disabled, provide the <em>client_id</em> to fetch public keys for your app. Otherwise, this endpoint returns the public keys automatically rotated.

>Okta strongly recommends retrieving keys dynamically with the JWKS published in the discovery document. It is safe to cache or persist downloaded keys for performance, but if your application is pinned to a signing key, you must check the keys as Okta automatically rotates signing keys.

There are standard open-source libraries available for every major language to perform [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) signature validation.

#### Alternative Validation 

You can use an [OAuth 2.0 introspection request](/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#introspection-request) for validation.

### OpenID Connect Discovery Document
