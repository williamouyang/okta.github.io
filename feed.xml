        <title>7 Essential .NET Developer Tools for 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every good dev knows that time spent setting up the perfect environment and searching out the latest tools is time well spent. Little things make a huge difference — upgrade your IDE plugins, automate a task or two, or look for new tools and libraries that can increase your efficiency. We’ve taken a crack at an updated list of our favorite .NET developer tools, that can simplify your life and amplify your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-jsonnet&quot;&gt;1. JSON.NET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that for any given project these days, you’ll be consuming a RESTful JSON API, producing one, or both. And even if you’re not, you may still be using JSON to serialize data or configuration on disk. Sure, you could get it done using System.Runtime.Serialization.Json, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://json.net/&quot;&gt;JSON.NET&lt;/a&gt; is faster and has tons of nice features to make your life easier. Built-in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/LINQtoJSON.htm&quot;&gt;LINQ-to-JSON&lt;/a&gt; support, plus the ability to query JSON using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/QueryJsonSelectTokenJsonPath.htm&quot;&gt;XPath-like syntax&lt;/a&gt; has earned this library the reputation as the de facto JSON implementation for .NET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-net-api-browser-and-reverse-package-search&quot;&gt;2. .NET API Browser (and Reverse Package Search)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a two-for-one for our second tool suggestion: the .NET API Browser and Reverse Package Search. As classes get moved around when their packages are refactored and reshuffled between versions, these two services are invaluable for tracking everything down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api&quot;&gt;.NET API Browser&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive reference for all classes and methods in the .NET API. The best part is that it autocompletes while you type, making it easy to locate APIs even when you can’t remember exactly where they exist in the package hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://packagesearch.azurewebsites.net&quot;&gt;Reverse Package Search&lt;/a&gt; lets you quickly search a vast collection of third party libraries, tagged with their respective supported versions of .NET Framework or .NET Core. It’s a little less curated than Microsoft’s official API browser, but the breadth makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-stylecopanalyzers&quot;&gt;3. StyleCop.Analyzers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that can really get a team of developers fussed up, it’s adhering to a consistent code formatting style. The only real solution is to adopt a formatting tool like StyleCop, and then share the configuration throughout the team. StyleCop can detect and fix a broad range of style offences, and can even be set up in some IDEs to work real-time as you type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers&quot;&gt;StyleCop.Analyzers&lt;/a&gt; is the latest incarnation of this project. Okta’s very own .NET evangelist &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nbarbettini&quot;&gt;Nate&lt;/a&gt; is a dedicated contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;4. Visual Studio Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; is Microsoft’s open source text editor and IDE. It’s beautiful and featureful and a joy to use. Not just for .NET, it works well with lots of language ecosystems and runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows. It’s got some similarities to Atom, but comes with IntelliSense, debugger, git integration, and can be extended even further with plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-posh-git&quot;&gt;5. Posh-git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been working for days on a major feature branch when a critical issue pops up in production? No worries: just commit to your feature branch, switch to the stable branch to push a fix, and switch back. Git (and modern version control in general) has really enabled this sort of multitasking on a codebase—but it can get confusing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git&quot;&gt;Posh-git&lt;/a&gt; (and its equivalent for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JeremySkinner/posh-svn&quot;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JeremySkinner/posh-hg&quot;&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zougi/posh-p4&quot;&gt;Perforce&lt;/a&gt;) modifies your shell prompt to include the current branch and other status information. It also provides tab-completion for your SCM commands and branch names, which results in a very nice git experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-resharper&quot;&gt;6. ReSharper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/&quot;&gt;ReSharper&lt;/a&gt; is the premier code analysis tool for Visual Studio. It provides analysis, linting, and refactoring assistance. From on-the-fly “quick fixes” to project-wide symbol renaming, this tool is like having your own co-pilot. It costs a few hundred bucks per year, but it should quickly pay for itself in increased productivity, and it comes with a 30-day trial so you can take it for a test drive. Combine it with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop.ReSharper&quot;&gt;StyleCop plugin&lt;/a&gt; and get the benefits of code format evaluation as you type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-xunitnet&quot;&gt;7. xUnit.net&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve invested in good unit test coverage, then you’re undoubtedly pretty committed to a testing framework already. But if you’re starting a new project, or just haven’t got around to writing any tests yet (we won’t judge) then look no further than &lt;a href=&quot;https://xunit.github.io&quot;&gt;xUnit.net&lt;/a&gt;. It is the successor to NUnit, and builds on the long lineage of similarly-named testing frameworks in other languages such as JUnit, CPPUnit, PHPUnit, and dozens more. However, xUnit has made some opinionated deviations to promote clearer more isolated tests that are easier to maintain, and a focus on data-driven testing using theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xUnit.net makes writing unit tests more approachable by providing the scaffolding to put them on. It supplies the infrastructure for basic fixturing and test running (including in parallel), and combines nicely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture&quot;&gt;AutoFixture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moq/moq&quot;&gt;Moq&lt;/a&gt; for writing concise and effective unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus--fluentassertions&quot;&gt;Bonus – FluentAssertions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of writing concise and effective unit tests, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentassertions.com&quot;&gt;Fluent Assertions&lt;/a&gt; is a library that enables expressive assertions. When a test fails, it’s important to be able to know why without reaching for the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibilities for tweaking and refining your development workflow go on and on. While shiny new tools have the potential to dramatically increase productivity, it’s easy to go down the rabbit hole of research and not actually get any work done. So now that you’ve got some new tricks, you can stop reading and go put them to work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What the Heck is OAuth?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of confusion around what OAuth &lt;em&gt;actually is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think OAuth is a login flow (like when you sign into an application with Google Login), and some people think of OAuth as a &lt;em&gt;“security thing”&lt;/em&gt;, and don’t really know much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to show you what OAuth is, explain how it works, and hopefully leave you with a sense of how and where OAuth can benefit your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-oauth&quot;&gt;What Is OAuth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin at a high level, OAuth is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an API or a service: it’s an open standard for authorization and anyone can implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with “secure delegated access”. OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two versions of OAuth: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849&quot;&gt;OAuth 1.0a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749&quot;&gt;OAuth 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. These specifications are &lt;em&gt;completely different&lt;/em&gt; from one another, and cannot be used together: there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; backwards compatibility between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one is more popular? &lt;em&gt;Great question!&lt;/em&gt; Nowadays, OAuth 2.0 is the most widely used form of OAuth. So from now on, whenever I say &lt;em&gt;“OAuth”&lt;/em&gt;, I’m talking about OAuth 2.0 – as it’s most likely what you’ll be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-oauth&quot;&gt;Why OAuth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth was created as response to the direct authentication pattern. This pattern was made famous by HTTP Basic Authentication, where the user is prompted for a username and password. Basic Authentication is still used as a primitive form of API authentication for server side applications: instead of sending a username and password to the server with each request, the user sends an API key ID and secret. Before OAuth, sites would prompt you to enter your username and password directly into a form and they would login to your data (e.g. your Gmail account) as you. This is often called &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/01/oauth-and-oauth-wrap-defeating-the-password-anti-pattern/&quot;&gt;the password anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a better system for the web, federated identity was created for single sign-on (SSO). In this scenario, an end user talks to their identity provider, and the identity provider generates a  cryptographically signed token which it hands off to the application to authenticate the user. The application trusts the identity provider. As long as that trust relationship works with the signed assertion, you’re good to go. The diagram below (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com/standards/OAuth/&quot;&gt;Okta’s OAuth docs&lt;/a&gt;) show how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/browser_spa_implicit_flow-aa8b504d81ca3e57be798da01b0d570a92287e1b28f8b6209c16ca500d4f34a6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Browser Implicit Flow&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federated identity was made famous by SAML 2.0, an OASIS Standard released on March 15, 2005. It’s a large spec but the main two components are its authentication request protocol (aka Web SSO) and the way it packages identity attributes and signs them, called SAML assertions. Okta does this with its SSO chicklets. We send a message, we sign the assertion, inside the assertion it says who the user is, and that it came from Okta. Slap on a digital signature on it and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saml&quot;&gt;SAML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAML is basically a session cookie in your browser that gives you access to webapps. It’s limited in the kinds of device profiles and scenarios you might want to do outside of a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When SAML 2.0 was launched in 2005, it made sense. However, a lot has changed since then. Now we have modern web and native application development platforms. There’s Single Page Applications (SPAs) like Gmail/Google Inbox, Facebook, and Twitter. They have different behaviors than your traditional web application, because they make AJAX (background HTTP calls) to APIs. Mobile phones make API calls too, as do TVs, gaming consoles, and IoT devices. SAML SSO isn’t particularly good at any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oauth-and-apis&quot;&gt;OAuth and APIs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed with the way we build APIs too. In 2005, people were invested in WS-* for building web services. Now, most developers have moved to REST and stateless APIs. REST is, in a nutshell, HTTP commands pushing JSON packets over the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers build a lot of APIs. The API Economy is a common buzzword you might hear in boardrooms today. Companies need to protect their REST APIs in a way that allows many devices to access them. In the old days, you’d enter your username/password directory and the app would login directly as you. This gave rise to the delegated authorization problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How can I allow an app to access my data without necessarily giving it my password?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever seen one of the dialogs below, that’s what we’re talking about. This is an application asking if it can access data on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/biketoworkday-fb-login-f00e39aabbf3e44bc3570333643cbf5d966fc27367dbffd2623ff4a3694831c3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook OAuth&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth is a delegated authorization framework for REST/APIs. It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user’s data without giving away a user’s password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities. It supports server-to-server apps, browser-based apps, mobile/native apps, and consoles/TVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of this like hotel key cards, but for apps. If you have a hotel key card, you can get access to your room. How do you get a hotel key card? You have to do an authentication process at the front desk to get it. After authenticating and obtaining the key card, you can access resources across the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To break it down simply, OAuth is where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App requests authorization from User
User authorizes App and delivers proof
App presents proof of authorization to server to get a Token
Token is restricted to only access what the User authorized for the specific App&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oauth-central-components&quot;&gt;OAuth Central Components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth is built on the following central components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes and Consent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authorization Server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oauth-scopes&quot;&gt;OAuth Scopes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scopes are what you see on the authorization screens when an app requests permissions. They’re bundles of permissions asked for by the client when requesting a token. These are coded by the application developer when writing the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/oauth-scopes-7ea53a0efe6c05a8113671297f641baae7486dfb6ab8b8357c74cb6e6f8371ce.png&quot; alt=&quot;OAuth Scopes&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scopes decouple authorization policy decisions from enforcement. This is the first key aspect of OAuth. The permissions are front and center. They’re not hidden behind the app layer that you have to reverse engineer. They’re often listed in the API docs: here are the scopes that this app requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to capture this consent. This is called trusting on first use. It’s a pretty significant user experience change on the web. Most people before OAuth were just used to name and password dialog boxes. Now you have this new screen that comes up and you have to train users to use. Retraining the internet population is difficult. There’s all kinds of users from the tech-savvy young folk to grandparents that aren’t familiar with this flow. It’s a new concept on the web that’s now front and center. Now you have to authorize and bring consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consent can vary based on the application. It can be a time-sensitive range (day, weeks, months), but not all platforms allow you to choose the duration. One thing to watch for when you consent is that the app can do stuff on your behalf - e.g. LinkedIn spamming everyone in your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth is an internet-scale solution because it’s per application. You often have the ability to log in to a dashboard to see what applications you’ve given access to and to revoke consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oauth-actors&quot;&gt;OAuth Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actors in OAuth flows are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Owner&lt;/strong&gt;: owns the data in the resource server. For example, I’m the Resource Owner of my Facebook profile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Server&lt;/strong&gt;: The API which stores data the application wants to access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client&lt;/strong&gt;: the application that wants to access your data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorization Server&lt;/strong&gt;: The main engine of OAuth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/oauth-actors-cd8b4861e839037400d8521e97c5d8cf0cb029add65d1036488991c7e85dcb72.png&quot; alt=&quot;OAuth Actors&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resource owner is a role that can change with different credentials. It can be an end user, but it can also be a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients can be public and confidential. There is a significant distinction between the two in OAuth nomenclature. Confidential clients can be trusted to store a secret. They’re not running on a desktop or distributed through an app store. People can’t reverse engineer them and get the secret key. They’re running in a protected area where end users can’t access them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public clients are browsers, mobile apps, and IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/oauth-clients-93fc6cc8e83fa7d885c9daa0ed88007fc44780b99682dcfa580af319894870c7.png&quot; alt=&quot;OAuth Clients&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Client registration also a key component of OAuth. It’s like the DMV of OAuth. You need to get a license plate for your application. This is how your app’s logo shows up in an authorization dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oauth-tokens&quot;&gt;OAuth Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access tokens are the token the client uses to access the Resource Server (API). They’re meant to be short-lived. Think of them in hours and minutes, not days and month. You don’t need a confidential client to get an access token. You can get access tokens with public clients. They’re designed to optimize for internet scale problems. Because these tokens can be short lived and scale out, they can’t be revoked, you just have to wait for them to time out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other token is the refresh token. This is much longer-lived; days, months, years. This can be used to get new tokens. To get a refresh token, applications typically require confidential clients with authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refresh tokens can be revoked. When revoking an application’s access in a dashboard, you’re killing its refresh token. This gives you the ability to force the clients to rotate secrets.  What you’re doing is you’re using your refresh token to get new access tokens and the access tokens are going over the wire to hit all the API resources. Each time you refresh your access token you get a new cryptographically signed token.. Key rotation is built into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OAuth spec doesn’t define what a token is. It can be in whatever format you want. Usually though, you want these tokens to be JSON Web Tokens (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt;). In a nutshell, a JWT (pronounced “jot”) is a secure and trustworthy standard for token authentication. JWTs allow you to digitally sign information (referred to as claims) with a signature and can be verified at a later time with a secret signing key. To learn more about JWTs, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://stormpath.com/blog/beginners-guide-jwts-in-java&quot;&gt;A Beginner’s Guide to JWTs in Java&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokens are retrieved from endpoints on the authorization server. The two main endpoints are the authorize endpoint and the token endpoint. They’re separated for different use cases. The authorize endpoint is where you go to get consent and authorization from the user. This returns an authorization grant that says the user has consented to it. Then the authorization is passed to the token endpoint. The token endpoint processes the grant and says “great, here’s your refresh token and your access token”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/authorization-server-99a4ad01368a4c8e407917358d4394d573a6c0e3c9fa10c01a59d1a54c4938cf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Authorization Server&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the access token to get access to APIs. Once it expires, you’ll have to go back to the token endpoint with the refresh token to get a new access token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is this causes a lot of developer friction. One of the biggest pain points of OAuth for developers is you having to manage the refresh tokens. You push state management onto each client developer. You get the benefits of key rotation, but you’ve just created a lot of pain for developers. That’s why developers love API keys. They can just copy/paste them, slap them in a text file, and be done with them. API keys are very convenient for the developer, but very bad for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a pay to play problem here. Getting developers to do OAuth flows increases security, but there’s more friction. There’s opportunities for toolkits and platforms to simplify things and help with token management. Luckily, OAuth is pretty mature these days, and chances are your favorite language or framework has tools available to simplify things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked a bit about the client types, the token types, and the endpoints of the authorization server and how we can pass that to a resource server. I mentioned two different flows: getting the authorization and getting the tokens. Those don’t have to happen on the same channel. The front channel is what goes over the browser. The browser redirected the user to the authorization server, the user gave consent. This happens on the user’s browser. Once the user takes that authorization grant and hands that to the application, the client application no longer needs to use the browser to complete the OAuth flow to get the tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tokens are meant to be consumed by the client application so it can access resources on your behalf. We call that the back channel. The back channel is a direct HTTP call directly from the client application to the resource server to exchange the authorization grant for tokens. These channels are used for different flows depending on what device capabilities you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/flow-channels-5d8996b3706cab1e4ac8f9ed716d6529d3970f91cbc3cb5ff5a21a94389d0e1d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flow Channels&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a Front Channel Flow where you authorize via user agent might look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource Owner starts flow to delegate access to protected resource&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client sends authorization request with desired scopes via browser redirect to the Authorize Endpoint on the Authorization Server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authorization Server returns a consent dialog saying “do you allow this application to have access to these scopes?” Of course, you’ll need to authenticate to the application, so if you’re not authenticated to your Resource Server, it’ll ask you to login. If you already have a cached session cookie, you’ll just see the consent dialog box. View the the consent dialog, and agree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The authorization grant is passed back to the application via browser redirect. This all happens on the front channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/front-channel-flow-4eb727aa0e67884935dd1642749fac60a7194815b8a1724aa11a0ce9adb80fa1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Front Channel Flow&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a variance in this flow called the implicit flow. We’ll get to that in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like on the wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&amp;amp;state=af0ifjsldkj
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a GET request with a bunch of query params (not URL-encoded for example purposes). Scopes are from Gmail's API. The redirect_uri is the URL of the client application that the authorization grant should be returned to. This should match the value from the client registration process (at the DMV). You don't want the authorization being bounced back to a foreign application. Response type varies the OAuth flows. Client ID is also from the registration process. State is a security flag, similar to XRSF. To learn more about XRSF, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://dzone.com/articles/cross-site-request-forgery&quot;&gt;DZone's &quot;Cross-Site Request Forgery explained&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://app.example.com/oauth2/callback?
code=MsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7&amp;amp;state=af0ifjsldkj
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; returned is the authorization grant and &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; is to ensure it's not forged and it's from the same request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Front Channel is done, a Back Channel Flow happens, exchanging the authorization code for an access token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Client application sends an access token request to the token endpoint on the Authorization Server with confidential client credentials and client id. This process exchanges an Authorization Code Grant for an Access Token and (optionally) a Refresh Token.
Client accesses a protected resource with Access Token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/back-channel-flow-7a2fb837d1950d5718ee788c2d904247edc5b06b9e3f399253da78636197cbbc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Back Channel Flow&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is how this looks in raw HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
POST /oauth2/v3/token HTTP/1.1
Host: www.googleapis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

code=MsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7&amp;amp;client_id=812741506391&amp;amp;client_secret={client_secret}&amp;amp;redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/oauth2/callback&amp;amp;grant_type=authorization_code
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant_type is the extensibility part of OAuth. It's an authorization code from a precomputed perspective. It opens up the flexibility to have different ways to describe these grants. This is the most common type of OAuth flow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
{
  &quot;access_token&quot;: &quot;2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&quot;,
  &quot;token_type&quot;: &quot;Bearer&quot;,
  &quot;expires_in&quot;: 3600,
  &quot;refresh_token&quot;: &quot;tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The response is JSON. You can be reactive or proactive in using tokens. Proactive is to have a timer in your client. Reactive is to catch an error and attempt to get a new token then.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an access token, you can use the access token in an Authentication header (using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;token_type&lt;/code&gt; as a prefix) to make protected resource requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer 2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&quot; \
  https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/1444587525/messages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you have a front channel, a back channel, different endpoints, and different clients. You have to mix and match these for different use cases. This up-levels the complexity of OAuth and it can get confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oauth-flows&quot;&gt;OAuth Flows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first flow is what we call the &lt;strong&gt;Implicit Flow&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason it’s called the implicit flow is because all the communication is happening through the browser. There is no backend server redeeming the authorization grant for an access token. An SPA is a good example of this flow’s use case. This flow is also called 2 Legged OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicit flow is optimized for browser-only public clients. An access token is returned directly from the authorization request (front channel only). It typically does not support refresh tokens. It assumes the Resource Owner and Public Client are on the same device. Since everything happens on the browser, it’s the most vulnerable to security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold standard is the &lt;strong&gt;Authorization Code Flow&lt;/strong&gt;, aka 3 Legged, that uses both the front channel and the back channel. This is what we’ve been talking about the most in this article. The front channel flow is used by the client application to obtain an authorization code grant. The back channel is used by the client application to exchange the authorization code grant for an access token (and optionally a refresh token). It assumes the Resource Owner and Client Application are on separate devices. It’s the most secure flow because you can authenticate the client to redeem the authorization grant, and tokens are never passed through a user-agent.
There’s not just Implicit and Authorization Code flows, there’s additional flows you can do with OAuth. Again, OAuth is more of a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For server-to-server scenarios, you might want to use a &lt;strong&gt;Client Credential Flow&lt;/strong&gt;. In this scenario, the client application is a confidential client that’s acting on its own, not on behalf of the user. It’s more of a service account type of scenario. All you need is the client’s credentials to do the whole flow. It’s a back channel only flow to obtain an access token using the client’s credentials. It supports shared secrets or assertions as client credentials signed with either symmetric or asymmetric keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric-key algorithms are cryptographic algorithms that allow you to decrypt anything, as long as you have the password. This is often found when securing PDFs or .zip files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys and private keys. Public keys can be read by anyone, private keys are sacred to the owner. This allows data to be secure without the need to share a password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a legacy mode called &lt;strong&gt;Resource Owner Password Flow&lt;/strong&gt;. This is very similar to the direct authentication with username and password scenario and is not recommended. It’s a legacy grant type for native username/password apps such as desktop applications. In this flow, you send the client application a username and password and it returns an access token from the Authorization Server. It typically does not support refresh tokens and it assumes the Resource Owner and Public Client are on the same device. For when you have an API that only wants to speak OAuth, but you have old-school clients to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more recent addition to OAuth is the &lt;strong&gt;Assertion Flow&lt;/strong&gt;, which is similar to the client credential flow. This was added to open up the idea of federation. This flow allows an Authorization Server to trust authorization grants from third parties such as SAML IdP. The Authorization Server trusts the Identity Provider. The assertion is used to obtain an access token from the token endpoint. This is great for companies that have invested in SAML or SAML-related technologies and allow them to integrate with OAuth. Because SAML assertions are short-lived, there are no refresh tokens in this flow and you have to keep retrieving access tokens every time the assertion expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in the OAuth spec, is a &lt;strong&gt;Device Flow&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s no web browser, just a controller for something like a TV. A user code is returned from an authorization request that must be redeemed by visiting a URL on a device with a browser to authorize. A back channel flow is used by the client application to poll for authorization approval for an access token and optionally a refresh token. Also popular for CLI clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered six different flows using the different actors and token types. They’re necessary because of the capabilities of the clients, how we needed to get consent from the client, who is making consent, and that adds a lot of complexity to OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people ask if you support OAuth, you have to clarify what they’re asking for. Are they asking if you support all six flows, or just the main ones? There’s a lot of granularity available between all the different flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-and-the-enterprise&quot;&gt;Security and the Enterprise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a large surface area with OAuth. With Implicit Flow, there’s lots of redirects and lots of room for errors. There’s been a lot of people trying to exploit OAuth between applications and it’s easy to do if you don’t follow recommended Web Security 101 guidelines. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twobotechnologies.com/blog/2014/02/importance-of-state-in-oauth2.html&quot;&gt;Always use CSRF token with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; parameter to ensure flow integrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always whitelist redirect URIs to ensure proper URI validations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bind the same client to authorization grants and token requests with a client ID&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For confidential clients, make sure the client secrets aren’t leaked. Don’t put a client secret in your app that’s distributed through an App Store!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest complaint about OAuth in general comes from Security people. It’s regarding the Bearer tokens and that they can be passed just like session cookies. You can pass it around and you’re good to go, it’s not cryptographically bound to the user. Using JWTs helps because they can’t be tampered with. However, in the end, a JWT is just a string of characters so they can easily be copied and used in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enterprise-oauth-20-use-cases&quot;&gt;Enterprise OAuth 2.0 Use Cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth decouples your authorization policy decisions from authentication. It enables the right blend of fine and coarse grained authorization. It can replace traditional Web Access Management (WAM) Policies. It’s also great for restricting and revoking permissions when building apps that can access specific APIs. It ensures only managed and/or compliant devices can access specific APIs. It has deep integration with identity deprovisioning workflows to revoke all tokens from a user or device. Finally, it supports federation with an identity provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oauth-is-not-an-authentication-protocol&quot;&gt;OAuth is not an Authentication Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize some of the misconceptions of OAuth 2.0: it’s not backwards compatible with OAuth 1.0. It replaces signatures with HTTPS for all communication. When people talk about OAuth today, they’re talking about OAuth 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because OAuth is an authorization framework and not a protocol, you may have interoperability issues. There are lots of variances in how teams implement OAuth and you might need custom code to integrate with vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol. It even says so in &lt;a href=&quot;https://oauth.net/articles/authentication/&quot;&gt;its documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/oauth-not-authentication-highlighted-b20b0ee8790740e1c354643e770dcd394ed9c6079812e5a85440e6dcbe14085a.png&quot; alt=&quot;OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been talking about delegated authorization this whole time. It’s not about authenticating the user, and this is key. OAuth 2.0 alone says absolutely nothing about the user. You just have a token to get access to a resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge number of additions that’ve happened to OAuth in the last several years. These add complexity back on top of OAuth to complete a variety of enterprise scenarios. For example, JWTs can be used as interoperable tokens that can be signed and encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudo-authentication-with-oauth-20&quot;&gt;Pseudo-Authentication with OAuth 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login with OAuth was made famous by Facebook Connect and Twitter. In this flow, a client accesses a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/me&lt;/code&gt; endpoint with an access token. All it says is that the client has access to the resource with a token. People invented this fake endpoint as a way of getting back a user profile with an access token. It’s a non-standard way to get information about the user. There’s nothing in the standards that say everyone has to implement this endpoint. Access tokens are meant to be opaque. They’re meant for the API, they’re not designed to contain user information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’re really trying to answer with authentication is &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; the user is, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; did the user authenticate, and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; did the user authenticate. You can answer typically answer these questions with SAML assertions, not with access tokens and authorization grants. That’s why we call this pseudo authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-openid-connect&quot;&gt;Enter OpenID Connect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the pseudo authentication problem, the best parts of OAuth 2.0, Facebook Connect, and SAML 2.0 were combined to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://openid.net/connect/&quot;&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/a&gt;. OpenID Connect (OIDC) extends OAuth 2.0 with a new signed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id_token&lt;/code&gt; for the client and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInfo&lt;/code&gt; endpoint to fetch user attributes. Unlike SAML, OIDC provides a standard set of scopes and claims for identities. Examples include: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;address&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OIDC was created to be internet scalable by making things completely dynamic. There’s no longer downloading metadata and federation like SAML requires. There’s built-in registration, discovery, and metadata for dynamic federations. You can type in your email address, then it dynamically discovers your OIDC provider, dynamically downloads the metadata, dynamically know what certs it’s going to use, and allows BYOI (Bring Your Own Identity). It supports high assurance levels and key SAML use cases for enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/openid-connect-protocol-suite-7e1d4655fc5f66461dc78fcb069fb54e3eb2eabf412a244c6617f49af747b3ba.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenID Connect Protocol Suite&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OIDC was made famous by Google and Microsoft, both big early adopters. Okta has made a big investment in OIDC as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that changes in the initial request is it contains standard scopes (like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?
scope=&lt;strong&gt;openid email&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;amp;
redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/oauth2/callback&amp;amp;
response_type=code&amp;amp;
client_id=812741506391&amp;amp;
state=af0ifjsldkj
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://app.example.com/oauth2/callback?
code=MsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7&amp;amp;state=af0ifjsldkj
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; returned is the authorization grant and &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; is to ensure it's not forged and it's from the same request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the authorization grant for tokens response contains an ID token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

  grant_type=authorization_code
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

  &quot;access_token&quot;: &quot;2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&quot;,
  &quot;token_type&quot;: &quot;Bearer&quot;,

}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this is layered nicely on top of OAuth to give back an ID token as a structured token. An ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT). A JWT (aka “jot”) is much smaller than a giant XML-based SAML assertion and can be efficiently passed around between different devices. A JWT has three parts: a header, a body, and a signature. The header says what algorithm was used to sign it, the claims are in the body, and its signed in the signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Open ID Connect flow involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discover OIDC metadata&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform OAuth flow to obtain id token and access token&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get JWT signature keys and optionally dynamically register the Client application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Validate JWT ID token locally based on built-in dates and signature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get additional user attributes as needed with access token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/oauth/oidc-flow-d93872818e8d040a5b7f1d02ac6b0a2d2961a91de72727f64ba47635dce5f2a1.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDF Flow&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oauth--okta&quot;&gt;OAuth + Okta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its single-sign on services that allow you to seamlessly authenticate to the applications you use on a daily basis. But did you know Okta also has an awesome developer platform? Secure single sign-on often uses SAML as the protocol of choice, but Okta also provides several other options, including a Sign-in Widget, Auth SDK (a JavaScript-based library), Social Login, and an Authentication API for any client. If you’re interested in learning about Okta’s Developer Platform straight from the source, you should attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/oktane17/&quot;&gt;Oktane17&lt;/a&gt; in late August. There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/oktane17/agenda/#AppDev&quot;&gt;track dedicated to app development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html&quot;&gt;Okta’s OAuth 2.0 API&lt;/a&gt; for specific information on how we support OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAML is implement by Okta with its SSO chicklets. If you’re an Okta customer, like me, you likely interact with most apps using something like https://okta.okta.com/app/UserHome. When you click on a chicklet, we send a message, we sign the assertion, inside the assertion it says who the user is, and that it came from Okta. Slap on a digital signature on it and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d rather watch a video to learn about OAuth, please see the presentation below from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jankytweet&quot;&gt;Karl McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Director of Identity at Okta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;max-width: 560px; margin: 0 auto&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework for delegated access to APIs. It involves clients that request scopes that Resource Owners authorize/give consent to. Authorization grants are exchanged for access tokens and refresh tokens (depending on flow). There are multiple flows to address varying client and authorization scenarios. JWTs can be used for structured tokens between Authorization Servers and Resource Servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth has a very large security surface area. Make sure to use a secure toolkit and validate all inputs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth is not an authentication protocol. OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0 for authentication scenarios and is often called “SAML with curly-braces”. If you’re looking to dive even deeper into OAuth 2.0, I recommend you check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oauth.com/&quot;&gt;OAuth.com&lt;/a&gt;, take Okta’s Auth SDK for a spin, and try out the OAuth flows for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Develop and Deploy Microservices with JHipster</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;JHipster is one of those open-source projects you stumble upon and immediately think, “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Of course!&lt;/code&gt;” It combines three 
very successful frameworks in web development: Bootstrap, Angular, and Spring Boot. Bootstrap was one of the first dominant 
web-component frameworks. Its largest appeal was that it only required a bit of HTML and it worked! Bootstrap showed many 
in the Java community how to develop components for the web. It leveled the playing field in HTML/CSS development, much 
like Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines did for iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, JHipster is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeoman.io/&quot;&gt;Yeoman&lt;/a&gt; generator. Yeoman is a code generator that you run with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yo&lt;/code&gt; 
command to generate complete applications or useful pieces of an application. Yeoman generators promote what the Yeoman 
team calls the “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yeoman workflow&lt;/code&gt;”. This is an opinionated client-side stack of tools that can help developers quickly 
build beautiful web applications. It takes care of providing everything needed to get working without the normal pains 
associated with a manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about JHipster, including its origin, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jhipster.github.io&quot;&gt;http://jhipster.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial shows you how to build a microservices architecture with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/2017/06/16/jhipster-release-4.5.4.html&quot;&gt;JHipster 4.5.4&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll generate a gateway (powered by Netflix Zuul and the JHipster Gateway), a microservice (that talks to MongoDB), and use Docker Compose to make sure it all runs locally. Then you’ll deploy it to Minikube and Google Cloud using Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-jhipster-4&quot;&gt;Install JHipster 4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jhipster.github.io/installation/&quot;&gt;Installing JHipster&lt;/a&gt; instructions show you all the tools you’ll need to 
use a released version of JHipster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Java 8 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;from Oracle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Git from &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;https://git-scm.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Node.js from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;http://nodejs.org&lt;/a&gt; (I used Node 6.11.0 to write this article)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Yarn using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install&quot;&gt;Yarn installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the following command to install &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeoman.io/&quot;&gt;Yeoman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; yarn global add yo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the following command to install JHipster&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; yarn global add generator-jhipster
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microservices-with-jhipster&quot;&gt;Microservices with JHipster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a microservices architecture with JHipster, you’ll need to generate two applications and clone another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate a gateway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate a microservice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clone the JHipster Registry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how these components fit in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/jhipster-microservices-architecture-1e6c15cf88acb3e263caa575b1e5ebfa49ef0ad49c880d6d80de3a377ab363e5.png&quot; alt=&quot;JHipster Microservices Architecture&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see what’s happening inside your applications, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/monitoring/#jhipster-console&quot;&gt;JHipster Console&lt;/a&gt;, 
a monitoring tool based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/products&quot;&gt;ELK Stack&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll cover JHipster Console in the Docker Compose section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-api-gateway&quot;&gt;Create an API Gateway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a microservices project, open a terminal window and create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; directory. Then 
create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory for the gateway application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p jhipster-microservices-example/blog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JHipster terms, a &lt;strong&gt;gateway&lt;/strong&gt; is a normal JHipster application. This means you can develop 
it like a monolith, but it also acts as the entrance to your microservices. More specifically, it provides HTTP 
routing and load balancing, quality of service, security, and API documentation for all microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a terminal, navigate to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;jhipster-microservices-example/blog
jhipster
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JHipster prompts you with many questions about the type of application you want to generate and what features you’d like 
to include. Create the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; application with the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application type: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Microservice gateway&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Base name of the application: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default package name: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.jhipster.blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JHipster Registry: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type of authentication: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JWT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type of database: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Production database: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Development database: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H2 with disk-based persistence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maven or Gradle: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other technologies: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client framework: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Angular 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sass for CSS: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internationalization support: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Native language: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;English&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additional languages: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spanish&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing frameworks: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gatling, Protractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install other generators from the JHipster Marketplace: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to use the same settings I did, you can place the following &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.yo-rc.json&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory and 
run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster&lt;/code&gt; in it. You won’t be prompted to answer any questions because the answers are already in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.yo-rc.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;generator-jhipster&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;promptValues&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;languages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;en&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;es&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project creation process will take a couple of minutes to run, depending on your internet connection speed. When it’s 
finished, you should see output like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/generation-success-fc29cd14ce05f64f4807082784ddf096868bcc37855156a150e5d0080a82945f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Generation success&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can run this project, you’ll need to download and start an instance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry&quot;&gt;JHipster Registry&lt;/a&gt;. 
Run the following commands in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:jhipster/jhipster-registry.git registry
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;registry &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; yarn &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; ./mvnw
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-registry/&quot;&gt;JHipster Registry&lt;/a&gt; is built on Spring Cloud Netflix and Spring Cloud Config. 
Patterns provided by Spring Cloud Netflix include Service Discovery (Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), Intelligent Routing (Zuul), 
and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/06/15/build-microservices-architecture-spring-boot&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I showed you how you can use Eureka for 
service discovery. JHipster Registry is a Eureka server, a Spring Cloud Config server, as well as an administration server. 
It includes dashboards to monitor and manage your JHipster applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JHipster Registry starts on port 8761 by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/jhipster-registry-6211c7c7d4a74b675f578e0f24837502ea8a53995330efc1749a265448d2ed5c.png&quot; alt=&quot;JHipster Registry&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new terminal window, navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster-microservices-example/blog&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./mvnw&lt;/code&gt; to start the blog application 
and open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; in your favorite browser. The first thing you’ll notice is a dapper-looking fellow 
explaining how you can sign in or register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/default-homepage-59cff05fbc224e96a69c3ae3f1479cc89027ef25a09565e0d008181604679f28.png&quot; alt=&quot;Default homepage&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign in with username &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and password &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll have access to navigate through the Administration section. 
This section offers nice looking UIs on top of some Spring Boot’s many monitoring and configuration features. It also 
allows you to administer users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/user-management-d9b7bdeec457183bb302d1567f2768870976c1a982bb20c8f7fab8d8b6ea0aef.png&quot; alt=&quot;User management&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives you insights into Application and JVM metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/app-metrics-6d55958cb4cef8848932f7cb500b24f43e6f5c4ead4ec270ee50d550f1ca6846.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application and JVM Metrics&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it allows you to see the Swagger docs associated with its API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/swagger-docs-1c4ab470f66d53215a00b1a7b084b6ddeb02191641f2cc6692a44e47be84c6c0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Swagger docs&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run the following command (in a separate terminal window) to start the Protractor tests and confirm everything is 
working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn e2e
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s a good idea to check your project into Git so you can easily see what changes are made going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
git add .
git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Gateway created&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shut down your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; application before proceeding to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-entities&quot;&gt;Generate Entities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each entity you want to create, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A database table&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Liquibase change set&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A JPA entity class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Spring Data &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/code&gt; interface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Spring MVC &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestController&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An Angular model, state, component, dialog components, service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several HTML pages for each component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you should have integration tests to verify that everything works and performance tests to verify that it runs fast. In an ideal world, you’d also have unit tests and integration tests for your Angular code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is JHipster can generate all of this code for you, including integration tests and performance tests. In addition, if you have entities with relationships, it will generate the necessary schema to support them (with foreign keys), and the TypeScript and HTML code to manage them. You can also set up validation to require certain fields, as well as control their length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JHipster supports several methods of code generation. The first uses its &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-entity/&quot;&gt;entity sub-generator&lt;/a&gt;. The entity sub-generator is a command-line tool that prompts you with questions which you answer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/&quot;&gt;JDL-Studio&lt;/a&gt; is a browser-based tool for defining your domain model with JHipster Domain Language (JDL). Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/&quot;&gt;JHipster-UML&lt;/a&gt; is an option for those that like UML. Supported UML editors include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modeliosoft.com/&quot;&gt;Modelio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umldesigner.org/&quot;&gt;UML Designer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genmymodel.com/&quot;&gt;GenMyModel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visual-paradigm.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. I like the visual nature of JDL-Studio, so I’ll use it for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the entity diagram and JDL code needed to generate a simple blog with blogs, entries, and tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/jdl-studio-blog-f6c10171bf61bd3f26fda6786baec6bba50377c32fc824f9bf17a6723d38d203.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blog entity diagram&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/jhipster4-blog-jdl&quot;&gt;click on this URL&lt;/a&gt;, or copy/paste the contents of the file below to your hard 
drive if you’d like to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;entity Blog {
    name String required minlength(3),
    handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Entry {
    title String required,
    content TextBlob required,
    date ZonedDateTime required
}

entity Tag {
    name String required minlength(2)
}

relationship ManyToOne {
    Blog{user(login)} to User,
    Entry{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
    Entry{tag(name)} to Tag{entry}
}

paginate Entry, Tag with infinite-scroll
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following command (in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory) to import this file. Running this command will generate entities, tests, and a UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jhipster import-jdl ~/Downloads/jhipster-jdl.jh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be prompted to overwrite &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/resources/config/liquibase/master.xml&lt;/code&gt;. Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to overwrite this 
file, as well as others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the application with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/.mvnw&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn start&lt;/code&gt; (in another window) to view the UI for the generated entities. 
Create a couple of blogs for the existing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; users, as well as a few blog entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/blogs-43eec411c0f7683d90a3bf378f06364f23115b37b6510e10d81e730b80ca3da2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blogs&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/entries-b2f637fafe4f414ebc37da264070b1c8d1540ace9d283835dd0d675bd4994027.png&quot; alt=&quot;Entries&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these screenshots, you can see that users can see each other’s data, and modify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, check your generated entities into Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
git add .
git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Entities generated&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-business-logic&quot;&gt;Add Business Logic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; To configure an IDE with your JHipster project, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/configuring-ide/&quot;&gt;Configuring your IDE&lt;/a&gt;. 
Instructions exist for Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, and NetBeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add more security around blogs and entries, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogResource.java&lt;/code&gt; and find the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getAllBlogs()&lt;/code&gt; method. Change the 
following line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blogRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blogRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findByUserIsCurrentUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;findByUserIsCurrentUser()&lt;/code&gt; method is generated by JHipster in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogRepository&lt;/code&gt; class and allows limiting results 
by the current user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BlogRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;select blog from Blog blog where blog.user.login = ?#{principal.username}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;findByUserIsCurrentUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change, re-compiling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogResource&lt;/code&gt; should trigger a restart of the application thanks to 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html&quot;&gt;Spring Boot’s Developer tools&lt;/a&gt;. 
If you navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:9000/blogs&quot;&gt;http://localhost:9000/blogs&lt;/a&gt;, you should only see the blog for the current user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/blogs-admin-5f2d635ead2b39744676fe3c6d413969c40596eadf41110d36f4eff6a6c932fd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Admin's blog&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add this same logic for entries, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EntryResource.java&lt;/code&gt; and find the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getAllEntries()&lt;/code&gt; method. Change the following line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entryRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pageable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entryRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findByBlogUserLoginOrderByDateDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SecurityUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getCurrentUserLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pageable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your IDE, create this method in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EntryRepository&lt;/code&gt; class. It should look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;findByBlogUserLoginOrderByDateDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currentUserLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pageable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pageable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recompile both changed classes and verify that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; user only sees the entries you created for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/entries-user-6174c5f4b653864af7c6ae5b12739a1fab5f7c2d8ba62bd731c166b994f45503.png&quot; alt=&quot;User's entries&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this changes, commit them to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;Add business logic&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice that this application doesn’t look like a blog and it doesn’t allow HTML in the content field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-ui-enhancements&quot;&gt;Make UI Enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doing UI development on a JHipster-generated application, it’s nice to see your changes as soon as you save a file. 
JHipster 4 uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.browsersync.io/&quot;&gt;Browsersync&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt; to power this feature. 
You enable this previously by running the following command in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, you’ll change the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the rendered content field to display HTML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the list of entries to look like a blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allow-html&quot;&gt;Allow HTML&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you enter HTML in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; field of a blog entry, you’ll notice it’s escaped on the list screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/entries-with-html-escaped-0eacff4f524fafd5776e7a205e97e7ba486838a86ffd6b23d135dc3644300660.png&quot; alt=&quot;Escaped HTML&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change this behavior, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;entry.component.html&lt;/code&gt; and change the following line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{entry.content}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change, you’ll see that the HTML is no longer escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/entries-with-html-4252d480bda493a261178c4f793c37283abded4f745a4770c57f821e29183ae9.png&quot; alt=&quot;HTML in entries&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-the-layout&quot;&gt;Improve the layout&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the list of entries look like a blog, replace &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;table-responsive&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with HTML, so it uses a stacked layout in a single column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;table-responsive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;entries&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it looks more like a regular blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/blog-entries-bd7c3d17bd49c9c75b2bab46afe39c1210ea03b58daaf72309d38e27ef80aaad.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blog entries&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit all your changes to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;UI enhancements&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-microservice&quot;&gt;Create a Microservice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; microservice, open a terminal window and navigate to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; directory.
Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; directory and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jhipster&lt;/code&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/jhipster-microservices-example
mkdir store
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;store
jhipster
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following settings to generate a microservice that uses MongoDB for its database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application type: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Microservice application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Base name of the application: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;8081&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default package name: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.jhipster.store&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type of authentication: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JWT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use JHipster Registry: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type of database: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maven or Gradle: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other technologies: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internationalization support: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Native language: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;English&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additional languages: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spanish&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing frameworks: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gatling&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install other generators from the JHipster Marketplace: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;enableTranslation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;applicationType&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;microservice&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;testFrameworks&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;gatling&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;jhiPrefix&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;jhi&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;skipClient&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;skipUserManagement&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;nativeLanguage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;en&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;languages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;en&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;es&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;clientPackageManager&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;yarn&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit your changes to Git. It’s always a good idea to do this before generating entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/jhipster-microservices-example/
git add store
git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Generate store application&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-product-entity&quot;&gt;Generate Product Entity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a product entity by running the following command in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jhipster entity product
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following answers for the questions asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to add a field to your entity? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the name of your field? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the type of your field? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to add validation rules to your field? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which validation rules do you want to add? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Required&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to add a field to your entity? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the name of your field? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;price&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the type of your field? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to add validation rules to your field? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which validation rules do you want to add? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Required&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you want to add a field to your entity? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to use a Data Transfer Object (DTO)? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to use separate service class for your business logic? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want pagination on your entity? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes, with pagination links&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your terminal should look similar to the following after you’ve answered all these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/generate-product-8cf735f9735afc28f198341841cb7429c0eef36f36ae8a1c9309d13a556b3d4a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Generating product entity&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-ui-for-product-entity&quot;&gt;Generate UI for Product Entity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A microservice only contains the server-side code for the entities it contains. To generate
an Angular UI for the product, navigate to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory and run the same command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jhipster entity product
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following answers to the questions asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to generate this entity from an existing microservice? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the path to the microservice root directory: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;../store&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to update the entity? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visual of these questions and answers is in the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/generate-product-ui-041dc6e22426ac438b0502a99eabbfbfcd850c26946e4b64666682bee29d5d77.png&quot; alt=&quot;Generating product entity UI&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit your changes to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ~/jhipster-microservices-example
git add .
git commit -m &quot;Add product entity&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should be able to verify everything works by starting the registry, blog, store, and MongoDB.
You can run MongoDB using Docker Compose with the following command in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; directory. You’ll need to have Docker installed and running for this command to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;#docker-compose&quot;&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt; section shows how you can run all your services using Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;, log in with admin/admin, and go to Entities &amp;gt; Product. You should be able to
add a product and see that it has a MongoDB identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/add-product-db7144bffa4902e715b63e8c7d7eec82cafcd15047f33c81b14f4eb0ff9e4266.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Product&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-for-production&quot;&gt;Build for Production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JHipster application can be deployed anywhere a Spring Boot application can be deployed. Its Angular client is
bundled inside its JAR files. JHipster ships with support for deploying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/cloudfoundry/&quot;&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/heroku/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/kubernetes/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/aws/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/boxfuse/&quot;&gt;AWS with Boxfuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you prepare a JHipster application for production, it’s recommended to use the pre-configured “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;production&lt;/code&gt;” profile. 
With Maven, you can package your application by specifying the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt; profile when building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mvnw -Pprod package
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production profile is used to build an optimized JavaScript client. You can invoke this using webpack by running 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn run webpack:prod&lt;/code&gt;. The production profile also configures gzip compression with a servlet filter, cache headers, 
and monitoring via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphite.wikidot.com/&quot;&gt;Graphite&lt;/a&gt; 
server configured in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;application-prod.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, your application will automatically send metrics data to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run this command in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; application, you’ll likely get a test failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Results :

Failed tests:
  BlogResourceIntTest.getAllBlogs:184 Status expected:&amp;lt;200&amp;gt; but was:&amp;lt;500&amp;gt;

Tests run: 157, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this happens is shown in a stack trace in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Running org.jhipster.blog.web.rest.BlogResourceIntTest
2017-06-19 10:29:17.288 ERROR 4168 --- [           main] o.j.b.w.rest.errors.ExceptionTranslator  
: An unexpected error occured: Authentication object cannot be null; nested exception is 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Authentication object cannot be null
2017-06-19 10:29:17.472 ERROR 4168 --- [           main] o.j.blog.web.rest.util.HeaderUtil        
: Entity processing failed, A new blog cannot already have an ID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, you can use Spring Security Test’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html/test-method.html#test-method-withmockuser&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@WithMockUser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogResourceIntTest.java&lt;/code&gt; and inject  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserRepository&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Autowired&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UserRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createEntity()&lt;/code&gt; method, so it’s not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; and uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;userRepository&lt;/code&gt; to set a user on the blog entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;createEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EntityManager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DEFAULT_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DEFAULT_HANDLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findOneByLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@WithMockUser&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getAllBlogs()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Transactional&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@WithMockUser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getAllBlogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit your changes to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;Fix tests&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing this test, you should be able to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./mvnw -Pprod package&lt;/code&gt; without any failures. You might notice that
this does take quite some time, mostly due to the Webpack build and optimizations. Below is the output from a Mid 2015
MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM and JAVA_OPTS set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-Xmx2048m&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-the-cloud&quot;&gt;Deploy to the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What good is a microservices architecture if it’s not deployed to a PaaS (Platform as a Service)?! PaaS providers
are also known as “the cloud”, and allow you to deploy and scale microservices as needed. Docker provides
a mechanism to “package” your applications as an entire bundle. A Docker container includes the operating system and 
services needed to run your application. Often, Docker containers are used for the individual components of your 
architecture. For example, you’ll have a Docker container for each app, as well as one for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and
Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete this section, you’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/&quot;&gt;install Docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re not on Mac or Windows, you may need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/&quot;&gt;install Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;docker-compose&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-with-docker-compose&quot;&gt;Run with Docker Compose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you can create and 
start all the components of your application with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure Docker is running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build Docker images for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; applications by running the following command in both directories:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project, and create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; directory. Then run the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/docker-compose/#docker-compose-subgen&quot;&gt;JHipster Docker Compose sub-generator&lt;/a&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; jhipster docker-compose
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Application type: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Microservice application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Root directory of your microservices: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;../&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Applications to include: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Applications with clustered databases: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Set up monitoring: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JHipster Console with ELK/Zipkin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The admin password for the JHipster Registry: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/generate-docker-26cd718e7905a8ef0ba2db98e709d55853c7996d0d9a62ea6801ff6f60a03c31.png&quot; alt=&quot;Generating Docker&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; to run all your services and see the logs in the same window. Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; if you want to run 
them as a daemon&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitematic.com/&quot;&gt;Kitematic&lt;/a&gt; to view the ports and logs for the services deployed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/kitematic-65f047ba2eb8c2639427d1f1de19a7a99910d4cf4c08c2d0a20039498a2e90b7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kitematic&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the JHipster Registry at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8761&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8761&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To produce data for the JHipster Console to display, run some Gatling tests in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mvnw gatling:execute
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These simulations can take a while (&amp;gt; 10m) to complete. When they’re finished, you can view their pretty reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/gatling-results-54f71d5b276eafec96b92d8bf21835da1902483234435b3b082079c0ffc89292.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gatling Results&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the JHipster Console at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:5601&quot;&gt;http://localhost:5601&lt;/a&gt;. Navigate to Dashboards &amp;gt; Open to display some pre-built 
dashboards for the JVM, logs, metrics, microservices, and performance. The screenshots below show you what some of 
these look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save your changes for Docker Compose, commit your changes to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;Add Docker Compose&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-with-kubernetes-and-minikube&quot;&gt;Run with Kubernetes and Minikube&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of 
containerized applications. It was developed at Google over the last 16 years and was internally called Borg. To deploy
Docker containers with Kubernetes, you set up a cluster, then deploy to it. The context can be local (with Minikube), or 
remote (e.g. a Raspberry Pi cluster, Google Cloud, AWS, OpenShift, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the steps below to use Kubernetes to deploy to a local cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/&quot;&gt;kubectl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases&quot;&gt;Minikube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start Minikube using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minikube start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be able to work with the docker daemon, run the following command in your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;minikube docker-env&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create Docker images of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; applications:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project, and create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; directory. Then run the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhipster.github.io/kubernetes/&quot;&gt;JHipster Kubernetes sub-generator&lt;/a&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; jhipster kubernetes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Application type: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Microservice application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Root directory of your microservices: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;../&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Applications to include: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The admin password for the JHipster Registry: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kubernetes namespace: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Base Docker repository name (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mraible&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;your-docker-hub-username&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Command to push Docker image to repository: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/generate-kubernetes-a51a2e3815d481f09a3afc98fa422accb30907eae16b3ab6e1955d278fa1046b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Generating Kubernetes&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the following commands to tag your Docker images. The Kubernetes sub-generator says to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker push&lt;/code&gt; as well, 
but you don’t need that for a Minikube deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; docker image tag blog mraible/blog
 docker image tag store mraible/store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the following commands in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; directory to deploy to Minikube.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; kubectl apply -f registry
 kubectl apply -f blog
 kubectl apply -f store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The deployment process can take several minutes to complete. Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minikube dashboard&lt;/code&gt; to see the deployed containers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-jhipster/minikube-dashboard-bebf1cae76f8f73fcc54aa86363b2098008a7fd24859a202ac70493113892aa0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Minikube Dashboard&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can also run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl get po -o wide --watch&lt;/code&gt; to see the status of each pod.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minikube service blog&lt;/code&gt; to view the blog application. You should be able to login and add blogs, entries, and products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove all deployed containers, run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl delete deployment --all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop Minikube, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minikube stop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save your changes for Kubernetes, commit your changes to Git from the top-level directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;Kubernetes&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploy-to-google-cloud&quot;&gt;Deploy to Google Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud is a PaaS that’s built on Google’s core infrastructure. It’s one of the easiest providers to support Kubernetes. 
Complete the steps below to deploy your hip microservices to Google Cloud. If you completed the Minikube section above, open 
a new terminal window to reset things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a Google Cloud project at &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.cloud.google.com/&quot;&gt;console.cloud.google.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list&quot;&gt;https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list&lt;/a&gt; to initialize the Container Engine for your project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/sdk/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud SDK&lt;/a&gt; and set project using:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcloud config set project &amp;lt;project-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a cluster:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcloud container clusters create &amp;lt;cluster-name&amp;gt; --machine-type=n1-standard-2 --scopes cloud-platform --zone us-west1-a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To see a list of possible zones, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcloud compute zones list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Push the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; docker images to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to create an account 
and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker login&lt;/code&gt; to push your images. The images can be run from any directory.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; docker image tag blog mraible/blog
 docker push mraible/blog
 docker image tag store mraible/store
 docker push mraible/store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; commands to deploy&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; kubectl apply -f registry
 kubectl apply -f blog
 kubectl apply -f store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use port-forwarding to see the registry app locally&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl port-forward jhipster-registry-0 8761:8761
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl get service blog&lt;/code&gt; to get the external IP of the blog application on Google Cloud. Open 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&amp;lt;external-ip&amp;gt;:8080&lt;/code&gt; to view your running application and verify everything works.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale microservice apps as needed with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you get everything working? If so, you rock! You’ve built a production-ready microservices scaffold for your application with JHipster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-found&quot;&gt;Issues Found&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creating this example, I ran into a few issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alert translations not resolved in the gateway for microservice entities. The workaround is to open the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/webapp/i18n/*/product.json&lt;/code&gt; files and move the keys from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;storeApp&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blogApp&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/5960&quot;&gt;issue #5960&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In production mode, new entries don’t show in the list. The logs have an error like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; 2017-06-19 18:08:06.930 ERROR 17597 --- [ XNIO-2 task-62] o.j.b.w.rest.errors.ExceptionTranslator  : 
 An unexpected error occured: Unable to access lob stream; nested exception is org.hibernate.HibernateException: 
 Unable to access lob stream
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hipster-labs/generator-jhipster-entity-audit/issues/32&quot;&gt;known issue with PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;.
 Adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Transactional&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EntryResource.java&lt;/code&gt; class definition solved this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running everything in Minikube, adding new products fails. Upgrading to JHipster Registry 3.0.2 solved this issue. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/jhipster-microservices-example/commit/5bed36131353aea148f5fee1cd8d3c4ed2ae00a8&quot;&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt; to see how to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Build a Microservices Architecture for Microbrews with Spring Boot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Adopting a microservice architecture provides unique opportunities to add failover and resiliency to your systems, so 
your components can handle load spikes and errors gracefully. Microservices make change less expensive too. It can also 
be a good idea when you have a large team working on a single product. Your project can likely be broken up into components 
that can function independently of one another. Once components can function independently, they can be built, tested, 
and deployed independently. This gives an organization and its teams the agility to develop and deploy very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, I showed you how to build 
a Spring Boot API with an Angular client. I then showed you how to 
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot&quot;&gt;convert the Angular app into a progressive web application that works offline&lt;/a&gt;. 
The Angular PWA is a good example of a resilient application because it still works when connectivity fails. Did you know 
you can develop similar resiliency in your API with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and a microservices architecture? This 
article shows you how to convert the previously created Spring Boot application to use microservices. You’ll create a 
beer catalog service, an edge service (for filter and displaying good beers), and a Eureka service that registers the 
services and allows them to communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the code tutorial, I’d like to talk a bit about microservices, their history, and why you should 
(or should not) consider a microservices architecture for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history-of-microservices&quot;&gt;History of Microservices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#History&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the term “microservice” was first used as 
a common architecture style at a workshop of software architects near Venice in May 2011. In May 2012, the same group 
decided “microservices” was a more appropriate name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft&quot;&gt;Adrian Cockcroft&lt;/a&gt;, who was at Netflix at the time, described this architecture 
as “fine-grained SOA”. Martin Fowler and James Lewis wrote an article titled simply 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html&quot;&gt;Microservices&lt;/a&gt; on March 25, 2014. Years later, this is still 
considered the definitive article for microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizations-and-conways-law&quot;&gt;Organizations and Conway’s Law&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has traditionally been organized into technology layers: UI team, database team, operations team. When teams 
are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project sucking down huge chunks of time 
and budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smart team will optimize around this and choose the lesser of two evils; forcing the logic into whichever application 
they have access to. This is an example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html&quot;&gt;Conway’s Law&lt;/a&gt; in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/conways-law-56c3557dd259e3eca55e0d0fc700df235fbaacf9af9dc53dc00af78dd625d951.png&quot; alt=&quot;Conway's Law&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the 
organization’s communication structure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— Melvyn Conway, 1967&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microservices-architecture-philosophy&quot;&gt;Microservices Architecture Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of a microservices architecture is essentially equal to the Unix philosophy of “Do one thing and do it well”. 
The characteristics of a microservices architecture are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Componentization via services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organized around business capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Products not projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smart endpoints and dumb pipes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decentralized governance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decentralized data management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infrastructure automation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design for failure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolutionary design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-microservices&quot;&gt;Why Microservices?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most developers, dev teams, and organizations, it’s easier to work on small “do one thing well” services. No single 
program represents the whole application, so services can change frameworks (or even languages) without a massive cost. 
As long as the services use a language agnostic protocol (HTTP or lightweight messaging), applications can be written 
in several different platforms - Java, Ruby, Node, Go, .NET, etc. - without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers and containers have made it easy to deploy microservices. All the technologies 
needed to support a monolith (e.g. load balancing, discovery, process monitoring) are provided by the PaaS, outside of 
your container. Deployment effort comes close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-microservices-the-future&quot;&gt;Are Microservices the Future?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architecture decisions, like adopting microservices, are usually only evident several years after you make them. 
Microservices have been successful at companies like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix. But that doesn’t 
mean they’ll be successful for your organization. Component boundaries are hard to define. If you’re not able to create 
your components cleanly, you’re just shifting complexity from inside a component to the connections between the components. 
Also, team capabilities are something to consider. A weak team will always create a weak system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t start with a microservices architecture. Instead, begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it 
into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— Martin Fowler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-a-microservices-architecture-with-spring-boot-spring-cloud-and-netflix-eureka&quot;&gt;Build a Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Netflix Eureka&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Eureka is a REST-based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for locating services for the purpose of 
load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/&quot;&gt;Spring Cloud&lt;/a&gt; is a developer’s dream when it comes to implementing and 
deploying a microservices architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems 
(e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, etc.). 
Coordination of distributed systems leads to boilerplate patterns. Using Spring Cloud, developers can quickly stand up 
services and applications that implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed environment, including 
the developer’s own laptop, bare metal data centers, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/&quot;&gt;Spring Cloud Netflix&lt;/a&gt; provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot 
applications. Patterns provided include Service Discovery (Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), Intelligent Routing (Zuul) 
and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about service discovery and resolution with Eureka, watch Josh Long’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/20/microservice-registration-and-discovery-with-spring-cloud-and-netflix-s-eureka&quot;&gt;Microservice Registration and Discovery with Spring Cloud and Netflix’s Eureka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-eureka-service&quot;&gt;Create a Eureka Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; directory. Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.spring.io&quot;&gt;start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt;. 
Enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eureka-service&lt;/code&gt; as an artifact name and select &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Eureka Server&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/eureka-service-a4a7139d34d39919709bfdbf50bd2d1f173282aa29061c9f3bf06fcd79119e2b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Eureka Server&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Generate Project&lt;/strong&gt; button and expand &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eureka-service.zip&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt; to add a port number and disable registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/java/com/example/EurekaServiceApplication.java&lt;/code&gt; and add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@EnableEurekaServer&lt;/code&gt; above &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@SpringBootApplication&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableEurekaServer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This annotation, and the aforementioned properties, configures a registry that other applications can talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the application from the command line using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mvnw spring-boot:run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you’re using Windows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mvnw.bat spring-boot:run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it starts, you should be able to open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8761&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8761&lt;/a&gt; and see there are no services available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/eureka-service-ui-4227ed9e91b45dffccc3c4820a31932d68d1d503a8f16e06f412796ac2852615.png&quot; alt=&quot;Eureka Server&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-beer-catalog-service&quot;&gt;Create a Beer Catalog Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refresh &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.spring.io&quot;&gt;start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt; to start creating a new project. Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/code&gt; for the 
artifact name and add the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actuator: features to help you monitor and manage your application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eureka Discovery: for service registration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JPA: to save/retrieve data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;H2: an in-memory database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest Repositories: to expose JPA repositories as REST endpoints&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web: Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DevTools: to auto-reload the application when files change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lombok: to reduce boilerplate code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/beer-catalog-service-c6d487b9ff257b82a5e8683e4400b0b577653c013a1648b7007db2fc12095e4e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beer Catalog Service&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Generate Project&lt;/strong&gt; button and expand &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service.zip&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; and 
open the project in your favorite IDE. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; because it’s great for 
Java and web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/code&gt; entity, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/code&gt; for it, and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; to populate the database with default data. 
You can add this code to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerCatalogServiceApplication.java&lt;/code&gt;, or create separate files for each class. The code below 
assumes you’re putting all classes in the same file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@NoArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@ToString&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Entity&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Id&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GeneratedValue&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RepositoryRestResource&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerInitializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerInitializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Good Morning&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Very Hazy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;King Julius&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Budweiser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Coors Light&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PBR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using an editor that doesn’t auto-import classes, here’s the list of imports needed at the top of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerCatalogServiceApplication.java&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;lombok.AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;lombok.Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;lombok.NoArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;lombok.ToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.stereotype.Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.persistence.Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.persistence.GeneratedValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.persistence.Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.stream.Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add an application name in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service/src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt; to display in the Eureka 
service, and set the port to 8080.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-properties highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;server.port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;spring.application.name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the beer-catalog-service with Maven (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt;) or your IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpie.org/&quot;&gt;HTTPie&lt;/a&gt; to see the list of beers from the catalog service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http localhost:8080/beers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/httpie-beers-55c9dd1ccc635e94d87126b68e1c6c7d2842922bada596895d6366b372b1af77.png&quot; alt=&quot;HTTPie Beers&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you open the Eureka Service at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8761&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8761&lt;/a&gt;, you will not see the service registered. To register 
the beer-catalog-service, you need to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@EnableDiscoveryClient&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerCatalogServiceApplication.java&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableDiscoveryClient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerCatalogServiceApplication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SpringApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerCatalogServiceApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-compile this class, watch devtools restart your application, and return to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8761&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8761&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not 
using an IDE, it might be easiest to cancel and restart &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt;. Now the service should show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/eureka-instances-registered-bec9bf9b85ba26b71cc28298fe1965a17bd615e5b78977ee435d36e3d89172a7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Eureka instances registered&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;intellij-auto-compile&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding: 12px 12px 2px 25px; border: 1px solid silver; border-left: 5px solid #ddd&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Compile on Save in IntelliJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default IntelliJ IDEA does not automatically compile files when the application is running. 
To enable the &quot;Compile on save&quot; feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;       
    &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&amp;gt; Compiler&lt;/strong&gt; and enable &quot;Build project automatically&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Open the Action window:
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Linux: CTRL+SHIFT+A&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Mac: SHIFT+COMMAND+A&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Windows: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+/&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;strong&gt;Registry...&lt;/strong&gt; and enable &lt;code&gt;compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-an-edge-service&quot;&gt;Create an Edge Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The edge service will be similar to the standalone beer service created in 
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular&quot;&gt;Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and Angular&lt;/a&gt;. 
However, it will have fallback capabilities which prevent the client from receiving an HTTP error when the service is 
not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.spring.io&quot;&gt;start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt; and create an “edge-service” application with the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eureka Discovery: for service registration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feign: a declarative web service client&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zuul: provides intelligent routing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest Repositories: to expose JPA repositories as REST endpoints&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web: Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hystrix: a circuit breaker to stop cascading failure and enable resilience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lombok: to reduce boilerplate code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/edge-service-c7e8714c119427b1c95b0264182bf4b964d8b023b49f5bd008f1e6a3086c79c0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edge Service&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Generate Project&lt;/strong&gt; button and expand &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service.zip&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-microservices-example&lt;/code&gt; and open 
the project in your favorite IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/code&gt; is running on port 8080, you’ll need to configure this application to run on a different 
port. Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service/src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt; to set the port to 8081 and set an application name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-properties highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;server.port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;8081&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;spring.application.name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;edge-service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable Feign, Hystrix, and registration with the Eureka server, add the appropriate annotations to 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EdgeServiceApplication.java&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.EnableCircuitBreaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.netflix.feign.EnableFeignClients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.EnableZuulProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableFeignClients&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableCircuitBreaker&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableDiscoveryClient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableZuulProxy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;EdgeServiceApplication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SpringApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EdgeServiceApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/code&gt; DTO (Data Transfer Object) in this same file. Lombok’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://projectlombok.org/features/Data.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will generate a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; methods, getters, setters, and 
appropriate constructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerClient&lt;/code&gt; that uses Feign to talk to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@FeignClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;beer-catalog-service&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;readBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestController&lt;/code&gt; that filters out less-than-great beers and exposes a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/good-beers&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; To get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.getName()&lt;/code&gt; to work in your IDE, you may need to install the Lombok plugin. In Intellij, you can 
install it by going to Preferences -&amp;gt; Plugins -&amp;gt; Browse Plugins. Search for “lombok plugin” and click to install it. 
Restart Intellij for the changes to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GoodBeerApiAdapterRestController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GoodBeerApiAdapterRestController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beerClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beerClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isGreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;isGreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Budweiser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Coors Light&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PBR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service&lt;/code&gt; application with Maven or your IDE and verify it registers successfully with the Eureka server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/edge-service-registered-95cc2264a08cfce06dc2e700178c2b54885d59b7f9966c8a6de67ec72a65de56.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edge Service Registered&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to invoke the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/good-beers&lt;/code&gt; endpoint as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;http localhost:8081/good-beers

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Good Morning&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Very Hazy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;King Julius&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is cool, but if you shut down the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/code&gt; application, you’ll get a 500 internal server error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;http localhost:8081/good-beers

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;error&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Internal Server Error&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;exception&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;java.lang.RuntimeException&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;message&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;com.netflix.client.ClientException: Load balancer does not have available server for client: beer-catalog-service&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;status&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;timestamp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1493142032310&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, you can use Hystrix to create a fallback method and tell the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;goodBeers()&lt;/code&gt; method to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@HystrixCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fallbackMethod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;fallback&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restart the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service&lt;/code&gt; and you should see an empty list returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;http localhost:8081/good-beers
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;UTF-8
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2017 17:44:18 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
X-Application-Context: edge-service:8081
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/code&gt; again and this list should eventually return the full list of good beer names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-an-angular-pwa-client&quot;&gt;Add an Angular PWA Client&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can copy the Angular PWA client I created in a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot&quot;&gt;previous tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and install its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-pwa-example.git
cp -r spring-boot-angular-pwa-example/client ~/spring-boot-microservices-example/.
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/spring-boot-microservices-example/client
npm install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then modify the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/shared/beer/beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;use port 8081&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8081/good-beers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBeerApiAdapterRestController&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EdgeServiceApplication.java&lt;/code&gt; to allow cross-origin requests from any client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restart the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service&lt;/code&gt; and start the Angular client by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; in the client directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/a&gt; in your browser and verify that network calls to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/good-beers&lt;/code&gt; go over port &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;8081&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/microservices-spring-boot/angular-pwa-800a8d50d995e9d877af0410d8bfb997ed8834ad035278ab6373ea3f10b94c6d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular PWA Client&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploy-to-cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;Deploy to Cloud Foundry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deploy the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service&lt;/code&gt; to Cloud Foundry, you need to add configuration files 
so they work with Cloud Foundry’s Eureka service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edge-service/src/main/resources/application-cloud.properties&lt;/code&gt; and populate it with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-properties highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${vcap.application.uris[0]:localhost}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.nonSecurePort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.client.region&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${vcap.services.pwa-eureka-service.credentials.uri}/eureka/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-catalog-service/src/main/resources/application-cloud.properties&lt;/code&gt; and populate it with similar properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-properties highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${vcap.application.uris[0]:localhost}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.nonSecurePort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.client.region&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${vcap.services.pwa-eureka-service.credentials.uri}/eureka/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the properties above, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pwa-eureka-service&lt;/code&gt; is the name you’ll give to the Eureka service when you deploy it to 
Cloud Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy it on Cloud Foundry with &lt;a href=&quot;http://run.pivotal.io/&quot;&gt;Pivotal Web Services&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to create an account, 
download/install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads&quot;&gt;Cloud Foundry CLI&lt;/a&gt;, and sign-in 
(using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few steps involved to deploy all the services and the Angular client for production. For that reason, 
I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-microservices-example/blob/master/deploy.sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; script 
that automates everything. Note that it uses a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-microservices-example/blob/master/sw.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sw.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Python script to change 
the names of Angular’s generated JavaScript files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-to-use-microservices&quot;&gt;When to Use Microservices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a microservices architecture is something you should consider when you’re having difficulty scaling development 
in a large team. From a development standpoint, moving to microservices will not reduce complexity, but will likely 
increase it you move to a distributed system. Automation and orchestration are key for deployment. You should make sure 
to define your exit criteria (e.g. maximum time for a request to execute) before implementing your microservices 
infrastructure. You’re likely going to have to custom build some things, so be prepared for that. Trial a few different 
platforms and then pick the one that meets your criteria and is the easiest to develop with. Don’t develop half of your 
system on one platform and then try moving to another. Another tip is to make sure and record the request ID in all 
logging events for traceability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have fewer than 20 developers, start with a monolith, but build in async messaging as soon as possible. Use it 
for things like mail, notifications, logging, and archiving. Debugging, deployment, and logging are much easier with a 
monolith because everything is contained in one application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, consider using async messaging or other non-blocking communication methods with automatic back pressure. HTTP is a 
synchronous protocol and can be a limiting factor in high-traffic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot isn’t the only framework to implement embedded servlet containers or make it easy to develop microservices. 
In Javaland, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropwizard.io/&quot;&gt;Dropwizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt; for Java EE,

        <title>Add Authentication to Your Angular PWA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’re developing a Progressive Web Application (PWA) and your service worker and web app manifest are working swimmingly. You’ve even taken the time to deploy it to a server with HTTPS and you’re feeling pretty good about  things. But wait, you don’t have any way of knowing who your users are! Don’t you want to provide them with an opportunity to authenticate and tell you who they are? Once you know who they are, you can give them all kinds of personalization options, inspire them to ❤️ your app, and maybe even support your work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’ll show you how you can lock down a Spring Boot app, then use a modern authentication protocol, in this case OpenID Connect (OIDC), to authenticate and gain access to its APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;secure-your-spring-boot-app&quot;&gt;Secure Your Spring Boot App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might’ve heard that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/blog/2017/03/stormpath-welcome-to-Okta/&quot;&gt;Stormpath joined forces with Okta&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago (February 2017). Since the transition, we’ve been working hard to make the Stormpath SDKs work with Okta’s API. The good news is we’ve made great progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, you’ll use Stormpath’s Spring Boot Starter to add security to a Spring Boot app. I’ll show you how this starter provides functionality such as login, forgot password, and user registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll show you how you can use OIDC and Okta’s Auth SDK in an Angular app to login and get data from the Spring Boot app. Finally, I’ll show how Stormpath’s Angular SDK has similar functionality to the Spring Boot Starter, providing login, user registration, and forgot password features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently created a Spring Boot app that provides a list of good beers, based on a pre-populated list. It filters out less-than-great beers and displays them in an Angular UI that displays the first animated GIF (from Giphy) that matches the beer name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than building Spring Boot and Angular applications from scratch, you can clone an existing GitHub project to get you going quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-pwa-example.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d prefer to build this application yourself, please read &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot&quot;&gt;Build Your First Progressive Web Application with Angular and Spring Boot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server/pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; file, you’ll need to add the following XML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stormpath.version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;2.0.0-okta-rc2&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/stormpath.version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.stormpath.spring&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;stormpath-default-spring-boot-starter&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependencyManagement&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.stormpath.sdk&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;stormpath-bom&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;${stormpath.version}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;pom&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;import&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependencyManagement&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started-with-okta&quot;&gt;Get Started with Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, you’ll need to create an Okta Developer account. This account is free forever and provides the complete Okta Identity Platform for up to 3 applications and 100 users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup&quot;&gt;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill out the signup form, and click “Get Started”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Within a few minutes you’ll get a confirmation email, follow the instructions in the email to finish setting up your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re set up you’ll receive a couple URLs. The first is an admin console URL that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/getting-started&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this one to manually change organization settings, create users, or other general administrative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other URL looks similar, but is missing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one your users could interact with, and will be the base URL for any API access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; The second URL (the non-admin one) is the one you will need to remember, you will use this URL for API access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup your Okta account for Spring Boot, you’ll first need to create an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-an-application&quot;&gt;Create an Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to your Admin console: i.e. https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the top menu click on &lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Add Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Create New App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;Create a New Application Integration&lt;/em&gt; popup, select the following values, then click &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Platform - Native&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sign-on Method - OpenID Connect&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;Create OpenID Connect Integration&lt;/em&gt; page, enter the following value, then click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Application Name - Spring Boot Awesomesauce&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/client/callback&lt;/code&gt; for the Redirect URIs, and click &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your application has been created, but you still have a few settings to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; tab, click &lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;General Settings&lt;/strong&gt; panel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the &lt;em&gt;Refresh Token&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Resource Owner Password&lt;/em&gt; checkboxes click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; on the Client Credentials panel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;em&gt;Use Client Authentication&lt;/em&gt; radio button, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;em&gt;Assignments&lt;/em&gt; tab and then select the &lt;em&gt;Assign&lt;/em&gt; button and &lt;strong&gt;Assign to Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;em&gt;Assign&lt;/em&gt; button in the &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; column, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab the ID portion of the URL of your browser’s current page. For example, if my URL was: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/app/oidc_client/instance/00icu81200icu812/#tab-assignments&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00icu81200icu812&lt;/code&gt; is my application’s ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; You will need to remember your application’s ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-an-access-token&quot;&gt;Create an Access Token&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to your Admin console&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the top menu click on &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Tokens&lt;/em&gt; tab and then click &lt;strong&gt;Create Token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the popup, give your new token a name like “Bootiful Token”, and click &lt;strong&gt;Create Token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; You will need to remember this token value, so copy/paste it somewhere safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information take a look at the official &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html&quot;&gt;Create an API token&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-the-spring-boot-app&quot;&gt;Run the Spring Boot App&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make your Spring Boot app aware of your Okta settings, you need to set a few environment variables. You can also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stormpath.com/java/servlet-plugin/config.html&quot;&gt;other options&lt;/a&gt; for setting these variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;STORMPATH_CLIENT_BASEURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=[&lt;/span&gt;baseurl_from_above]
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OKTA_APPLICATION_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=[&lt;/span&gt;application_id_from_above]
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OKTA_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=[&lt;/span&gt;api_token_from_above]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, start it up…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd server 
./mvnw spring-boot:run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll be prompted to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/spring-boot-login-225f9b949e279ba11a8a61a21ca460967aa39eb84ef9c3ea8be8fee35e33df4a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spring Boot Login&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you call the API with a different &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/code&gt; header (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;application/json&lt;/code&gt;), you’ll get a JSON response. The command below uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpie.org/&quot;&gt;HTTPie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;http localhost:8080/login

                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;password&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;create-open-id-connect-app&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-openid-connect-app-for-angular&quot;&gt;Create an OpenID Connect App for Angular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user and obtain their basic profile information. To get started you’ll need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log in to your Okta account and navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Admin &amp;gt; Add Applications&lt;/strong&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;Create New App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Single Page App (SPA)&lt;/strong&gt; for the Platform and &lt;strong&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/strong&gt; for the sign on method&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; and give your application a name (e.g. Angular PWA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the next screen, add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/code&gt; as a Redirect URI and click &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;. You should see settings like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%{ img blog/angular-pwa-auth/oidc-settings.png alt:”Okta OIDC Settings” width:”800” %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Assignments&lt;/strong&gt; tab and select &lt;strong&gt;Assign&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Assign to Groups&lt;/strong&gt;. Select the &lt;em&gt;Assign&lt;/em&gt; button in the &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; column, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;authenticate-with-openid-connect&quot;&gt;Authenticate with OpenID Connect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the Angular application by running the following commands in your project’s root directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;client
npm install
ng serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive an error like the one below, modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; to use the latest version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@angular/cli&lt;/code&gt; or disable the warning using the instructions provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Your global Angular CLI version (1.0.3) is greater than your local
version (1.0.0). The local Angular CLI version is used.

To disable this warning use &quot;ng set --global warnings.versionMismatch=false&quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll likely see a cross-origin request error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:8080/good-beers. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 
header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:4200' is therefore 
not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 403. If an opaque response serves 
your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re using Spring Boot without the Stormpath Spring Boot starter, you can use a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/code&gt; annotation to enable cross-origin resource 
sharing (CORS) on the server. See the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular#configure-cors-for-spring-boot&quot;&gt;configure CORS for Spring Boot section&lt;/a&gt; of 
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular&quot;&gt;Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and Angular&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re using the Stormpath Spring Boot Starter, you can enable it by adding the following property to the Spring 
Boot app’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stormpath.web.cors.allowed.originUris=http://localhost:4200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, remove the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/code&gt; annotation from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController.java&lt;/code&gt; since it’s no longer needed. Make sure to save the files you changed and your server auto-restarted. If it did not, kill it and restart it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manfredsteyer&quot;&gt;Manfred Steyer’s&lt;/a&gt; project to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc&quot;&gt;add OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect support&lt;/a&gt; to your Angular client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save angular-oauth2-oidc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/app.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/code&gt; and configure your app to use your Okta application settings (replacing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[oidc-client-id]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[dev-id]&lt;/code&gt; with the values from your “Angular PWA” OIDC app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'angular-oauth2-oidc'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;redirectUri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[oidc-client-id]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'openid profile email'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oidc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;issuer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://dev-[dev-id].oktapreview.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loadDiscoveryDocument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tryLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/app/app.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;router-outlet&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;app-beer-list&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shellNoRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/home/home.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; and configure it to display &lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Logout&lt;/strong&gt; buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'beer-list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerListComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;canActivate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'home'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'home'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pathMatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'full'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'**'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'home'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;RouterModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, you should be able to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; and see a login button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-login-button-7e1214a060ddbc6ce425c49604350ad21b26ddf8b41006ab48b2b6c833cc0b8c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Login Button&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt; button and sign-in with one of the user’s that are configured in your Okta application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-okta-login-b372a3a7b78d981e9594f4176bed393871eeb3454b55a380a62fd372ce3c4d14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Okta Login&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will likely fail with an error similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://dev-158606.oktapreview.com/.well-known/openid-configuration net::ERR_FAILED
error loading discovery document 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this problem, you need to add the client’s URL as a Trusted Origin for a cross-origin request. Login to your Okta dashboard and navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt;. Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Trusted Origins&lt;/strong&gt; tab and click the &lt;strong&gt;Add Origin&lt;/strong&gt; button. Enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/code&gt; for the Origin URL, give it a name like “Angular PWA”, check &lt;strong&gt;CORS&lt;/strong&gt;, and click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to login and see a welcome message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-welcome-13b72426905bebff3cc8720b32ae0c8fca5a5c34df830a6142b304665b7b41a1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Welcome&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Beer List&lt;/strong&gt; to see data from your Spring Boot app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-beer-list-fd9362900de843aee144424e560e6724fa029c97dfe1b219c348620dccbceab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Beer List&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add the “Home” link at the top (as shown in the screenshot above), modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/beer-list/beer-list.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to include the following HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;md-button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;routerLink=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/home&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-card-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Beer List&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-card-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-list-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let beer of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;md-list-avatar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{beer.giphyUrl}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{beer.name}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;md-line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          {{beer.name}}
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-list-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you toggle “offline” in Chrome Developer Tools’ Network tab, you’ll see it all works offline too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-beer-list-offline-fbaaa9a2c9b056055e61cc650242f026bb5f49ce38068152eb0607395abc75f6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular PWA Works Offline&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it works - great, now we can add auth with Okta!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authenticating-with-the-okta-auth-sdk&quot;&gt;Authenticating with the Okta Auth SDK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Okta Auth SDK builds on top of Okta’s &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/api/resources/authn.html&quot;&gt;Authentication API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/api/resources/oidc.html&quot;&gt;OAuth 2.0 API&lt;/a&gt; to enable you to create a fully branded sign-in experience using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it using npm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @okta/okta-auth-js --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a reference to this library’s main JavaScript file in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/.angular-cli.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;../node_modules/@okta/okta-auth-js/dist/okta-auth-js.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt; to declare &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OktaAuth&lt;/code&gt; and modify its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; so it has a sign-in form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaAuth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngIf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;givenName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;givenName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;raised&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;logout()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes,  run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt; should render as follows (after you’ve logged out and unchecked “Offline” in the Network tab):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-login-form-6953f2234df666355b1affa5f5aa333752252f10d05ca1442b20067ee9494233.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Login Form&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import Angular’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt;, add it as a dependency in the constructor, and add local variables for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; fields. Then implement a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loginWithPassword()&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt;. This method uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OktaAuth&lt;/code&gt; library to get a session token and exchange it for ID and access tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/router'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'We cannot handle the '&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' status'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to sign in with the form as one of your app’s registered users. After logging in, you’ll be able to click the &lt;strong&gt;Beer List&lt;/strong&gt; link and view the beer list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;authenticate-with-the-stormpath-angular-sdk&quot;&gt;Authenticate with the Stormpath Angular SDK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a former Stormpath customer migrating to Okta, you might’ve used Stormpath’s Angular, AngularJS, or React SDKs. The good news is that these libraries should still work with Okta!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you weren’t a Stormpath customer, you can still use these libraries to talk to Okta. In the future, we’ll be releasing Okta SDKs with similar functionality. In the meantime, we’ll do our best to support these libraries and make it easy to transition to future versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save the code your wrote for OIDC, I recommend committing your changes to Git. Run the command below from the root directory of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -a -m &quot;Add Security with OIDC and Okta&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create a new branch for the Stormpath Angular SDK integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b stormpath
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install Stormpath’s Angular SDK to make it possible to communicate with the secured server. Make sure to run the following command from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save angular-stormpath
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StormpathModule&lt;/code&gt;. Then create a function to configure the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpointPrefix&lt;/code&gt; to point to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'angular-stormpath'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stormpathConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;spConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;spConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;endpointPrefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8080'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;spConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;autoAuthorizedUris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;RegExp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;spConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;endpointPrefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/*'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;spConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StormpathModule&lt;/code&gt; to the imports in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@NgModule&lt;/code&gt; and use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stormpathConfig&lt;/code&gt; function to override the default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/code&gt; list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathModule&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stormpathConfig&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/home/home.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; to add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sp-authport&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sp-authport&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component and a section to show the user’s name and a logout link. In other words, replace all the code in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;home.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; with the code below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthPortComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'angular-stormpath'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'sp-authport { margin-top: 20px; display: block; }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngIf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;(user$ | async)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/md-card-title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;raised&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;logout(); return&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routerLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/beer-list&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/md-card-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/md-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/sp-authport&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthPortComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user$&lt;/code&gt; variable in the HTML. This comes from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AuthPortComponent&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt; extends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to make two more changes to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/app/shared/auth/auth.guard.ts&lt;/code&gt;, replace &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Stormpath&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ActivatedRouteSnapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CanActivate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;RouterStateSnapshot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/router'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Stormpath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'angular-stormpath'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CanActivate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stormpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Stormpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canActivate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ActivatedRouteSnapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;RouterStateSnapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stormpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/home'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stormpath Angular SDK will automatically send &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; headers to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/*&lt;/code&gt; based on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;autoAuthorizedUris&lt;/code&gt; setting in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;. You can modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; so this URL isn’t duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/http'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs/add/operator/map'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'angular-stormpath'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StormpathConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;endpointPrefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/good-beers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sp-authport&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component expects Bootstrap’s CSS to be available. To add Bootstrap, install it from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; directory using npm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save bootstrap@3.3.7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a reference to Bootstrap’s CSS file in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/.angular-cli.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;styles&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;styles.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your app is started (with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; directory, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; directory) and navigate to http://localhost:4200. You should see a login screen like the one below and see the same post-login screen as you did with OIDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you still see the OIDC login screen, it’s because PWAs often get “stuck” in your browser. In Chrome Developer Tools, navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt; tab &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Clear storage&lt;/strong&gt; and click &lt;strong&gt;Clear selected&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom. Or just open an incognito window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/angular-sp-login-462ba2834e4c5b0834c55f59ba0e3dfc05856bc7aac966cab1b1aaebb2cff782.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stormpath Angular SDK Login&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of issues I found when writing this tutorial. Please subscribe to the following GitHub issues to be notified when they’re fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-java/issues/1335&quot;&gt;Registering a new user doesn’t work with Angular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-java/issues/1336&quot;&gt;OAuth invalid credentials results in “Invalid grant” as error&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;Deploy to Cloud Foundry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time for one of the coolest places on the internet - &lt;em&gt;production!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you deploy these applications to production, I recommend stopping both. That way there’s no resource contention for file access. Commit your changes to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stormpath&lt;/code&gt; branch and checkout the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -a -m &quot;Integrate Stormpath Angular SDK for login&quot;
git checkout master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy this app to Cloud Foundry, you’ll need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory to set environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the URL of the server in a different file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pushstate: enabled&lt;/code&gt; to  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Staticfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-angular-pwa-example/blob/master/deploy.sh&quot;&gt;modified deploy.sh on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Copy the contents of this file on top of your existing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; An alternative to enabling push state is to use hashes in the URL. To do this, you can pass in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;useHash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; when creating your routes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;RouterModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useHash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this causes the redirect login button to fail since there are now two hashes in the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html&quot;&gt;Install the Cloud Foundry CLI&lt;/a&gt;, then log into &lt;a href=&quot;http://run.pivotal.io/&quot;&gt;Pivotal Web Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; and watch the magic happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you navigate to the client’s URL after deploying, you’ll see an error like the following in Chrome’s console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://dev-158606.oktapreview.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 
'https://pwa-client-phototopographical-subcurrent.cfapps.io' is therefore not allowed access.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, modify the Trusted Origins on Okta (under &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt;) to have your client’s URL (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://pwa-client-phototopographical-subcurrent.cfapps.io&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/add-cf-origin-c6bc12f60e457ce0acaf993e1a7333fbe704beb4755954ef5ed6f7e1201daa64.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Trusted Origin&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the cross-origin error go away, but it will cause an invalid request issue when you try to log in with the first login button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/invalid-redirect-c34a59e8e0e3b73d6f9c3dc754fc126f343f31330aa36b36c5f0b7f59bc9fd66.png&quot; alt=&quot;Invalid Redirect URI&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, modify the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Redirect URIs&lt;/code&gt; for your “Angular PWA” OIDC application in Okta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/oidc-settings-cf-redirect-f41d70d1ad2f7b2bf93a61b98a3c48e21ad28b8d1cc2f39aa6be3b29741336f1.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC Redirect URIs&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now both login techniques should work as expected and you should be able to load the beer list from your Spring Boot app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/production-beer-list-069b194886b120a85778b16d84dbf6b0ac07898da64444ec57a2006658cadc72.png&quot; alt=&quot;Production Beer List&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/&quot;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; on this application, I was surprised to see it received a PWA score of 91. When I deployed this application previously, it &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot#cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;received a 98&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-pwa-auth/lighthouse-without-512-53c26aca1ffcb6b6c4f5775a4d6c1594938ad97266322a2d9a575c96e9447c17.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lighthouse Score, first attempt&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the advice in the report and added the following in the list of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;icons&lt;/code&gt; in  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client/src/assets/icons/manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;src&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/icons/android-chrome-512x512.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;sizes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;512x512&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;image/png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I re-deployed (by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; again) with this change, I received a 100. &lt;em&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: I did have to update the Trusted Origins and Redirect URIs in Okta after I redeployed since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; picks a random name to deploy to each time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article showed you how to develop a Spring Boot backend, and lock it down with Okta. You learned how to develop an Angular frontend and use OpenID Connect to get an access token and securely communicate with the backend. You also learned how you can use the Stormpath Angular SDK to do the same thing. Finally, you saw how to deploy everything to Cloud Foundry and get a Lighthouse PWA score of 100.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tutorial: Develop a Mobile App With Ionic and Spring Boot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You already know that building APIs with Spring Boot is incredibly easy. But, your API isn’t complete without a UI, right? Well, building UIs with Ionic is pretty easy too, especially if you know Angular!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic is an open source framework designed to help you build mobile applications with web technologies. It started out as a framework based on AngularJS. Ionic 3.0 was recently released, with support for Angular 4, TypeScript 2.2, and lazy loading. When developing an Ionic app, you’ll use Angular and have access to native APIs via Ionic Native and Apache Cordova. This means you can develop slick-looking UIs using the technologies you know and love: HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show you how to build a Spring Boot API and an Ionic app, and then how to deploy the finished product to your iOS or Android-based mobile device. Together, these technologies provide an excellent developer experience, with hot reloading so you see immediate feedback whenever you change files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html&quot;&gt;Java 8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-new-spring-boot-project&quot;&gt;Create a New Spring Boot Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, create a directory on your hard drive called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-ionic-example&lt;/code&gt;. During this tutorial, you will create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic-beer&lt;/code&gt; directories to hold the server and client applications, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-a-spring-boot-api&quot;&gt;Build a Spring Boot API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about how to build a Spring Boot API in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular&quot;&gt;Bootiful Development with Spring Boot with Angular&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than covering that again, you can clone the existing project and copy the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; directory into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-ionic-example&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-example.git
cp -r spring-boot-angular-example/server ~/spring-boot-ionic-example/.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project contains a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/code&gt; API that allows you to &lt;abbr title=&quot;Create, Read, Update, and Delete&quot;&gt;CRUD&lt;/abbr&gt; a list of beer names. It also contains a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/good-beers&lt;/code&gt; endpoint that filters out less-than-great beers. A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerCommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; class creates the default list of beers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerCommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BeerCommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Top beers from https://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Good Morning&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Very Hazy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;King Julius&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Budweiser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Coors Light&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PBR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/code&gt; interface is decorated with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@RepositoryRestResource&lt;/code&gt; to expose CRUD endpoints for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/code&gt; entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RepositoryRestResource&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the API is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/code&gt; that exposes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/good-beers&lt;/code&gt; and specifies cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isGreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;isGreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Budweiser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Coors Light&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PBR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to start the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; application by running it in your favorite IDE or from the command line using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt;. You’ll want to do this from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you don’t have Maven installed, you can use the Maven wrapper that’s included in the project (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./mvnw spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the app has started, navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/good-beers&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/good-beers&lt;/a&gt;. You should see the list of good beers in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/good-beers-json-e1d41f9859ef735fa60939aa8ceeffba8f73c26f3da69013fc69c6e2ad027d57.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good Beers JSON&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-ionic-app&quot;&gt;Create an Ionic App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an Ionic app to display data from your API, you’ll first need to install Ionic CLI and Cordova:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g ionic cordova
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/&quot;&gt;Ionic CLI&lt;/a&gt; is a command-line tool that significantly reduces the time it takes to develop an Ionic app. It’s like a Swiss Army Knife: It brings together a bunch of miscellaneous tools under a single interface. The CLI contains a number of useful commands for Ionic development, such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installation completes, create a new application using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ionic start ionic-beer --type ionic-angular
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted to select a starter project and optionally link your app to your Ionic Dashboard. For the purposes of this tutorial, choose the &lt;strong&gt;tabs&lt;/strong&gt; starter project and do not link the app to your Ionic Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;ionic-beer
ionic serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will open your default browser on &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8100&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8100&lt;/a&gt;. You can click through the tabbed interface to see the default structure of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/ionic-tabs-a947a40668cf63af0155359e4c7c44c0b035ca171a6c2c8fd5235f47940caf96.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ionic shell with tabs&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic-beer&lt;/code&gt; project in your preferred IDEA to start creating your UI. I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA because it has good TypeScript support and can auto-import classes just like it does for Java project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-good-beers-ui&quot;&gt;Create a Good Beers UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic generate page beer&lt;/code&gt; to create a component and a template to display the list of good beers. This creates a number of files in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/beer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beer.html
beer.module.ts
beer.scss
beer.ts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; and add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerPageModule&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/code&gt; list in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerPageModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../pages/beer/beer.module'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BrowserModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IonicModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerPageModule&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/providers/beer-service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to hold a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt; that fetches the beer list from the Spring Boot API. Populate it with constants for the API path and add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getGoodBeers()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/http'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs/add/operator/map'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs/add/operator/catch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8080'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BEER_API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/beers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getGoodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/good-beers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you receive TypeScript errors with this code, make sure your imports match. In particular, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; needs to be imported for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getGoodBeers()&lt;/code&gt; to compile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the HTML in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/beer/beer.html&lt;/code&gt; to show the list of beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-navbar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Good Beers&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-navbar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let beer of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{beer.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/beer/beer.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt; and add it as a provider. You could add it as a provider in each component, but adding it in the module allows all components to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../../providers/beer-service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/beer/beer.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt; and add it as a dependency in the constructor. Call the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getGoodBeers()&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionViewDidLoad()&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IonicPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavParams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ionic-angular'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../../providers/beer-service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IonicPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'page-beer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'beer.html'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expose this page on the tab bar, modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/tabs/tabs.ts&lt;/code&gt; and re-arrange things so &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerPage&lt;/code&gt; is second in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../beer/beer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'tabs.html'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TabsPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/tabs/tabs.html&lt;/code&gt; to have the new tab order and to specify which icon to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-tabs&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tab2Root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tabTitle=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Beer&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tabIcon=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;beer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-tab&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tab4Root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tabTitle=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;About&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tabIcon=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;information-circle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-tab&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-tabs&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-some-fun-with-animated-gifs&quot;&gt;Add Some Fun with Animated GIFs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/code&gt; class in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/providers/giphy-service.ts&lt;/code&gt; with code that searches Giphy’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/code&gt; and include it as a provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../../providers/giphy-service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../../providers/beer-service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ionViewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.html&lt;/code&gt; to display the image retrieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let beer of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-avatar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;item-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{beer.giphyUrl}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-avatar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{beer.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the Spring Boot app in one terminal window and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; in another. Open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8100&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8100&lt;/a&gt; in your browser. Click on the Beer icon, and you’ll likely see an error in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Uncaught (in promise): Error: No provider for Http!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/no-http-provider-da85a2e1b4601e81e16697457b5923b7af4457881c52a6df8973a9e14e266a1d.png&quot; alt=&quot;No provider for Http!&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlights one of the slick features of Ionic: errors display in your browser, not just the browser’s console. Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HttpModule&lt;/code&gt; to the list of imports in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; to solve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HttpModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/http'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BrowserModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HttpModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IonicModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerPageModule&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change, you’ll likely see the following error in your browser’s console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8080/good-beers. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8100' is therefore
not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 401.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, open your Spring Boot application’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController.java&lt;/code&gt; class and change its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/code&gt; annotation to allow &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8100&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt;. This enables cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) from both the browser and the mobile client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://localhost:8100&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file://&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recompile this class, and DevTools should restart the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything works as expected, you should see a page similar to the one below in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/good-beers-ui-0f728f4d0add9daa51b4cf14c61d49ef0f085efad12ca7ccd6b522d60ce0c5cf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good Beers UI&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-a-modal-for-editing&quot;&gt;Add a Modal for Editing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the header in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.html&lt;/code&gt; to have a button that opens a modal to add a new beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-navbar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Good Beers&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-buttons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ion-button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;icon-only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;openModal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;()&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-icon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;add-circle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-icon&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-icon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;beer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-icon&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-buttons&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-navbar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same file, change &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to have a click handler for opening the modal for the current item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let beer of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;openModal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;})&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ModalController&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.ts&lt;/code&gt; and add an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openModal()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IonicPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ModalController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavParams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ionic-angular'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-modal.ts&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory.

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the import for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerModalPage&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.ts&lt;/code&gt;, then create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/beer/beer-modal.html&lt;/code&gt; as a template for this page.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-col&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-col&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-row&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-row&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-col&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;error&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;alert alert-danger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{error}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ion-button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;full&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;submit&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]=&quot;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beerForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Save&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-col&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-row&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BEER_API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'href'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BEER_API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, if you try to add or edit a beer name, you’ll likely see an error in your browser’s console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Uncaught (in promise): Error: No component factory found for BeerModalPage.
Did you add it to @NgModule.entryComponents?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this problem, add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerModalPage&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;declarations&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;entryComponent&lt;/code&gt; lists in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerModalPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./beer-modal'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerModalPage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;entryComponents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerModalPage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you try to edit a beer’s name, you’ll see another CORS in your browser’s console. Add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/code&gt; annotation to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerRepository.java&lt;/code&gt; (in your Spring Boot project) that matches the one in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RepositoryRestResource&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://localhost:8100&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file://&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-compile and now everything should work as expected. For example, below is a screenshot that shows I added a new beer and what it looks like when editing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/beer-modal-eb516a421ed1335ce0a47d6f852fc5aa60806dd9a8f51f1f64babec0de07f240.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mmmmm, Guinness&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-swipe-to-delete&quot;&gt;Add Swipe to Delete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add swipe-to-delete functionality on the list of beers, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.html&lt;/code&gt; and make it so &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item-sliding&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; wraps &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and contains the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*ngFor&lt;/code&gt;. Add a delete button using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item-options&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item-sliding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let beer of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;openModal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;})&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-avatar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;item-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{beer.giphyUrl}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-avatar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{beer.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item-options&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ion-button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;danger&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-icon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;trash&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-icon&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Delete
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item-options&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item-sliding&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; method to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toastCtrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Beer &quot;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&quot; deleted.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'top'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add and import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ToastController&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency in the constructor, so everything compiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navCtrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;modalCtrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ModalController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toastCtrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ToastController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BEER_API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these additions, you should be able to delete beer names. To emulate a left swipe in your browser, click on the item and drag it to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/beer-delete-47606c79fa81afbb866445c7cb2b1ca9c3074cbde87e44c4c5bd8560f7eee1d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Left swipe&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pwas-with-ionic&quot;&gt;PWAs with Ionic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic ships with support for creating progressive web apps (PWAs). If you’d like to learn more about what PWAs are, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ionic.io/navigating-the-world-of-progressive-web-apps-with-ionic-2/&quot;&gt;Navigating the World of Progressive Web Apps with Ionic 2&lt;/a&gt;. This blog post is still relevant for Ionic 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/&quot;&gt;Lighthouse Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; on this application, you’ll likely get a mediocre score in the 50s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/lighthouse-51-7f0306ed217ab55e97b818efd820da9ab6e00eaf0e7b21767dd20512d602081f.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;blog/ionic-spring-boot/lighthouse-51.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To register a service worker, and improve the app’s score, uncomment the following block in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- un-comment this code to enable service worker
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')
    .then(() =&amp;gt; console.log('service worker installed'))
    .catch(err =&amp;gt; console.log('Error', err));
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change, the score should improve. In my tests, it increased to 75/100. The remaining issues were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A couple -1’s in performance for “Cannot read property ‘ts’ of undefined”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Site is not progressively enhanced (page should contain some content when JavaScript is not available). You could likely solve this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/app-shell&quot;&gt;Angular’s app-shell directives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Site is not on HTTPS and does not redirect HTTP to HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you refresh the app and Chrome doesn’t prompt you to install the app (a PWA feature), you probably need to turn on a couple of features. Copy and paste the following URLs into Chrome and enable each feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks
chrome://flags/#enable-add-to-shelf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enabling these flags, you’ll see an error in your browser’s console about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/assets/imgs/logo.png&lt;/code&gt; not being found. This file is referenced in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;. You can fix this by copying a 512x512 PNG (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iconsdb.com/orange-icons/beer-icon.html&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) into this location or by modifying &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. At the very least, you should modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; to have your app’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-a-mobile-device&quot;&gt;Deploy to a Mobile Device&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty cool that you’re able to develop mobile apps with Ionic in your browser. However, it’s nice to see the fruits of your labor and see how awesome your app looks on a phone. It really does look and behave like a native app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how your application will look on different devices you can run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic serve --lab&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--lab&lt;/code&gt; flag opens a page in your browser that lets you see how your app looks on different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To emulate or deploy to an iOS device, you’ll need a Mac and a fresh installation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&quot;&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like to build iOS apps on Windows, Ionic offers an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionic.io/cloud#packaging&quot;&gt;Ionic Package&lt;/a&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure to open Xcode to complete the installation.&lt;/strong&gt; Then run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic cordova emulate ios&lt;/code&gt; to open your app in Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest problem I found when running the app in Simulator was that it was difficult to get the keyboard to popup. To workaround this, I used &lt;strong&gt;Hardware&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Toggle Software Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; when I needed to type text in a field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying to your phone will likely fail because it won’t be able to connect to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;. To fix this, you can deploy your Spring Boot app to a public server, or use your computer’s IP address in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; (if you’re on the same wireless network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy to Cloud Foundry, copy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-ionic-example/blob/master/deploy.sh&quot;&gt;this deploy.sh script&lt;/a&gt; to your hard drive. It expects to be in a directory above your apps (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-ionic-example&lt;/code&gt;). It also expects your apps to be named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic-beer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a Cloud Foundry account, you’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://account.run.pivotal.io/z/uaa/sign-up&quot;&gt;create one&lt;/a&gt;. Then install its command line tools (and login) for this script to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew tap cloudfoundry/tap &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; brew install cf-cli
cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After logging into Cloud Foundry, you should be able to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt;. This script will deploy the server and modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to point to it. It will also try to deploy to your phone, so you may need to complete the steps below before it will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy the app to an iPhone, start by plugging it into your computer. Then run the following commands to install ios-deploy/ios-sim, build the app, and run it on your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g ios-deploy ios-sim
ionic cordova build ios --prod
open platforms/ios/MyApp.xcodeproj
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select your phone as the target in Xcode and click the play button to run your app. The first time you do this, Xcode may spin for a while with a “Processing symbol files” message at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you run into code signing issues, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/#ios-devices&quot;&gt;Ionic’s deployment documentation&lt;/a&gt; to see how to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve configured your phone, computer, and Apple ID to work, you should be able to open the app and see the beer list you created. Below is how it looks on my iPhone 6s Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/iphone-beer-list-bc77d973cf975064c628d7c34b28d717f60a23b19757eae87e494f2bc9b2f95e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Phone Beer List&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To emulate or deploy to an Android device, you’ll first need to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html&quot;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the install, it will show you where it installed the Android SDK. Set this path as an ANDROID_HOME environment variable. On a Mac, it should be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Library/Android/sdk/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve just installed Android Studio, make sure to open it to complete the installation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy to the Android emulator, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic cordova emulate android&lt;/code&gt;. This will install Andorid support and print out instructions about how to create an emulator image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error: No emulator images (avds) found.
1. Download desired System Image by running:
/Users/mraible/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android sdk
2. Create an AVD by running: /Users/mraible/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd
HINT: For a faster emulator, use an Intel System Image and install the HAXM device driver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the first suggestion and download your desired system image. Then run the second command and created an AVD (Android Virtual Device) with the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AVD Name: TestPhone
Device: Nexus 5
Target: Android 7.1.1
CPU/ABI: Google APIs Intel Axom (x86_64)
Skin: Skin with dynamic hardware controls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; These instructions won’t work with version 2.3.2 of Android Studio on Mac. When you try to run the first command, it’ll say the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;*************************************************************************
The &quot;android&quot; command is deprecated.
For manual SDK, AVD, and project management, please use Android Studio.
For command-line tools, use tools/bin/sdkmanager and tools/bin/avdmanager
*************************************************************************
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, open Android Studio, select “Open an existing Android Studio project” and select the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic-beer/platforms/android&lt;/code&gt; directory. If prompted to upgrade, choose “OK”, then proceed to create a new AVD as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd&quot;&gt;described in Android Studio’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After performing these steps, you should be able to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ionic cordova emulate android&lt;/code&gt; and see your app running in the AVD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/ionic-spring-boot/android-beer-list-89882cfa6fb9f2fc8b34b486be59cbfdac142c12fb3d3f8d691f97e6428060d5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Android Beer List&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: If you get an application error that says “The connection to the server was unsuccessful. (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;file:///android/www/index.html&lt;/code&gt;)”, add the following line to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.xml&lt;/code&gt;. This sets the default timeout to 60 seconds (default is 20). Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/31377846&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; for the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;preference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;loadUrlTimeoutValue&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;60000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>A Developer's Guide To Docker - A Gentle Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works on my machine.&lt;/em&gt; We’ve all heard it. Most of us have said it. It’s been impossible to get around it… until now. Not only can adding Docker to your development environment solve that issue, but it can make it drop-dead simple to onboard new developers, keep a team working forward and allow everyone on the team use their desired tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-containers&quot;&gt;Why Containers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aren’t containers just lightweight Virtual Machines?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the question I get most often when I start talking to folks about containers. If it helps, you can think of them that way; but containers bring a lot more to the game than just a lightweight VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-containerization-with-docker&quot;&gt;Before Containerization with Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be, that if you wanted to host an application on your corporate network, it would take &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt;. The operations team would have to make a request for the hardware, it would have to be approved, the finance department would have to make a purchase order, the ops team would have to order the hardware and when it got in, they’d have to put it in the server rack, get it on the network, install the operating system, and any other software needed to run your application. Of course, when ops people order servers, they don’t order the Intel Celeron processor and 512Mb of RAM; they get the 24, quad-core Xeon processor server with 15 bajillion gigabytes of RAM. This means that once your app is installed, the server runs at about 3% utilization. Not ideal from a CapEx and OpEx cost standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-the-virtual-machine&quot;&gt;Enter the Virtual Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Machines helped with some of the utilization issues. You could use that monster server to host several VMs and get the utilization much closer to 80 or 90 percent. But you still had to install operating systems, software dependencies and make sure each gets patched with updates. This means logging into each virtual machine and updating and securing each. So if you have a farm of 20 VMs, that’s 20 times of logging in, loading patches, securing, etc. Some automation tools have made this process less labor-intensive, but it’s still not ideal. You’d also have to decide at design time how much resources to set aside for the virtual machine. Those resources are then lost by the host machine while the virtual machine is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;containers-to-the-rescue&quot;&gt;Containers to the Rescue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers take the idea of the virtual machine one step farther. Instead of setting up a virtual machine and setting aside resources for it, you could let a container run like an application. It takes only as much resources as it needs to do it’s job. You can limit the amount of resources it can access, but when it’s doing nothing, it takes up almost no resources. When a virtual machine is doing nothing, it is still running a full-blown OS, and all the software that your application needs are still taking up resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers share the host operating system’s kernel. They run just like applications. They are given user space, but the underlying processes needed to run the application are owned by the host machine. This make them not only lightweight, but less resource intensive than VMs, because VMs need resources just to run the operating system and base processes. Having their own user space means that they are secured away from the host operating system, but they share kernel processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a network or operations guy, I am just a developer. So it helps for me to think of containers as just applications, that think they’re full machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/&quot;&gt;Docker installed&lt;/a&gt;, let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-technical-terminology&quot;&gt;Some Technical Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, it’s important to get your head around two main terms: Images and Containers. Images are saved containers that you can then turn around and use to make other containers. If you’ve done any object-oriented development, you know that a class is a blueprint for creating an object. Images are like blueprints for creating containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listing-and-getting-images&quot;&gt;Listing and Getting Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To list the images you have downloaded to your host machine, run a simple command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker image list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/docker-for-developers/docker-image-list-e3625942b732eef4164c6b16517ef5b556348f21a9b2059e6b7ac6644eb13e1c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker Image List&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see some headers, but nothing in the listing (unless you have pulled some container images before). I have a few images already on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pull the latest version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/&quot;&gt;NGINX&lt;/a&gt; image from &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;, run the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker pull nginx:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/docker-for-developers/docker-pull-65d41ddcf8e26f6ec0ca7b8f71b7cb691034c09ac42679d65616cf9f57f8ad85.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker Pull&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can leave off the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt; and Docker will pull the image tagged with latest, but we’ll be explicit here. Just remember that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt; changes every time the owner of that image uploads a new version. So it’s not a good idea to use latest in production. Generally, the latest image will also have another tag (1.13.0 at the time of this article) that is much better to use for production. It will still be the same image, even if NGINX uploads a new version of the image tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-containers&quot;&gt;Running Containers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now run a container based on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nginx:latest&lt;/code&gt; image by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -it nginx:latest /bin/bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/docker-for-developers/docker-run-it-52467fb1a4206f5e0ca810b8b3160f2f332013a8c553edbb98b289812f356dde.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker Run&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells Docker that we want to run a container based on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nginx:latest&lt;/code&gt; image, that we want it to be interactive (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt;), that we want a pseudo tty shell (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/code&gt;), and finally, we want the main command for this container to be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;. This runs the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; command at process ID 1 in the container. This means, when the bash shell in the container exits, the container will stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be dropped into a shell for the nginx container. We can open a new terminal while that one is running and see it from the host by typing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker container list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this should give is a listing like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/docker-for-developers/docker-ps-dee9d2044bee5fcec3224c96ec1bc8cdf25d4e9116051c108a3a1668f5e1fe39.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker Container List&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the container’s ID is: 511b121137ac and at the command line inside the container, I am logged in as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root@511b121137ac&lt;/code&gt;. You can also see the command is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; that is running at PID 1 in the container and the container name is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;determined_banach&lt;/code&gt; (it will be different for you). If you don’t specify a name for the container, Docker will make one from a list of adjectives and famous computer scientist last names (think &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hungry_babbage&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slippery_bohr&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; at the command line inside the container, we’ll be dropped back into the host machine’s command line. If we go to our other terminal (where we listed running containers) and re-run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker container list&lt;/code&gt; command, we’ll see an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to see &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the containers whether they’re running or not? You can run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker container list&lt;/code&gt; command with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; switch (for all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker container list -a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/docker-for-developers/docker-ps-a-9fb653f03693fd9f22829b25939695d010b32e000d1f57794c9f11265df625d9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker Image List All&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the nginx-based container is now stopped and it exited with a code ‘0’, meaning it exited normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cleaning-up-your-docker-environment&quot;&gt;Cleaning Up Your Docker Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because the container isn’t running, doesn’t mean it’s gone. It’s still there in a stopped state. If you want to actually delete a container from your host machine you use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; command like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker rm determined_banach
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Container ID&lt;/code&gt; to remove a container, but you actually only have to give it as much of the ID as you need to make it unique in the list of containers. So if there are three containers on the host that all start with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;41...&lt;/code&gt; you would just have to type the first three characters of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Container ID&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;416&lt;/code&gt; for example) to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide you don’t want to build any more containers from a particular image, you can remove it with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rmi&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker rmi nginx:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to specify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt; for the image tag, Docker will assume you’re referring to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt; if you don’t specify, but it’s good practice to always use a tagged image. In a production scenario, it’s important to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt;, as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt; image is updated whenever a new version of the image is pushed to the repository. So the image you get with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:latest&lt;/code&gt; tag today maybe &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; different from the one you got yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-containers-to-come&quot;&gt;More Containers to Come!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for future posts about Docker where we’ll look at creating images and containers from a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; and how to coordinate an environment of containers (API, database and UI) with Docker-Compose.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build Your First Progressive Web Application with Angular and Spring Boot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent DoubleClick report that found 53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes more than 3 seconds to load. That same report said the average mobile sites load in 19 seconds. According to Alex Russell in his recent talk on the state of mobile development, one of the biggest problems in mobile today is that developers use powerful laptops and desktops to develop their mobile applications, rather than using a $200 device on a 3G connection. Using this environment is “ground truth” to the majority of web users in the world. It’s cool to develop native applications, but people with slow phones and internet don’t want to download a 60MB app, they just want to use the web. Progressive web applications, or PWAs, are one of the easiest ways to make web applications faster and easier to use, allowing developers to build a better internet for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the full video of Alex’s talk to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1SFnrf4jZo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Adapting to the Mobile Present&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PWAs are becoming increasingly popular in web development. Most of the information about PWAs on the web today comes from Google and its network of Google Developer Experts. This isn’t surprising as Google is often promoting the latest and greatest web technologies. They also develop their own browser, Chrome, which makes it possible to use many of the new standards in HTML5, JavaScript and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-a-pwa&quot;&gt;So What is a PWA?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PWAs leverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot;&gt;Transport Layer Security&lt;/a&gt; (TLS), webapp manifests, and service workers to make an application installable with offline capabilities. In other words, a PWA is like a native app on your phone, but it’s built with web technologies like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3. If built right, a PWA is indistinguishable from a native application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-progressive-web-apps-to-build-better-mobile-apps&quot;&gt;Use Progressive Web Apps to Build Better Mobile Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat the problems Alex Russell calls to light, and ultimately build better mobile apps, he recommends five techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement the PRPL pattern&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a ~$150-200 unlocked Android (e.g. Moto G4)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use chrome://inspect &amp;amp;&amp;amp; chrome://inspect?tracing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse&quot;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; and use it to analyze your applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Chrome DevTools Network and CPU Throttling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google engineer Addy Osmani describes &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/&quot;&gt;the PRPL pattern&lt;/a&gt; in an article on Google’s Web Fundamentals site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PRPL is a pattern for structuring and serving Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), with an emphasis on the performance of app delivery and launch. It stands for:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push&lt;/strong&gt; critical resources for the initial URL route.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Render&lt;/strong&gt; initial route.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-cache&lt;/strong&gt; remaining routes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy-load&lt;/strong&gt; and create remaining routes on demand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist&quot;&gt;Progressive Web App Checklist&lt;/a&gt; lists all the things you’ll need to make a progressive webapp. However, I like the simple list that Alex Russell lists on &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2016/09/what-exactly-makes-something-a-progressive-web-app/&quot;&gt;What, Exactly, Makes Something A Progressive Web App?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/alex-russell-pwas-e15d04f035b31af65625edf6113c00c7520e995047c56e495e2ebd2c1c03ec0d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alex Russell&amp;#039;s PWA Checklist&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will show you how to build a PWA with a Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend. It’ll work offline and I’ll show how to deploy it to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-a-spring-boot-api&quot;&gt;Run a Spring Boot API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular&quot;&gt;part 1 of this series&lt;/a&gt;, I showed you how to create an API with Spring Boot and display its data in an Angular UI. You’ll be using that project as a starting point for this tutorial. You’ll adding offline capabilities by turning it into a PWA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, clone the project from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-example.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the “server” project in your favorite IDE and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DemoApplication&lt;/code&gt; or start it from the command line using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./mvnw spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-build your application and navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/good-beers&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/good-beers&lt;/a&gt;. You should see the list of good beers in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/good-beers-json-e1d41f9859ef735fa60939aa8ceeffba8f73c26f3da69013fc69c6e2ad027d57.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good Beers JSON&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see the result in your terminal window using HTTPie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http localhost:8080/good-beers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;progressive-web-apps-with-angular&quot;&gt;Progressive Web Apps with Angular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my PWAs learning journey while sitting in a conference session with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jshcrowthe&quot;&gt;Josh Crowther&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://stormpath.com/blog/angular-and-microservices-rich-web-experience-2016&quot;&gt;The Rich Web Experience&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2haHF1y&quot;&gt;Progressive Web Apps: The Future of the Web&lt;/a&gt; presentation taught me everything I needed to know to get started. However, his examples used Polymer and I wanted to create a PWA with Angular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started researching how to build PWAs with Angular, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.angular.io&quot;&gt;mobile.angular.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/mobile.angular.io-12d299aa9cbee13266ce47a34ee93a262249044daa33d4bd0d22bf7304f3fc49.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Mobile Toolkit&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website seemed to be exactly what I needed and I was pumped to find a tutorial showing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/mobile-toolkit/blob/master/guides/cli-setup.md&quot;&gt;how to build a PWA with Angular CLI&lt;/a&gt;. After installing Angular CLI, I tried the tutorial’s recommended first step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
ng new hello-mobile --mobile
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed to find the latest version of Angular CLI (1.0.0) does not support the mobile flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/ng-new-mobile-3c03db9a1fb9bb400eb3ecd8883c33dc9a47d09723a567ad53e1bbbb25ac85ca.png&quot; alt=&quot;ng new with mobile flag&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching through the project’s GitHub issues, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/mobile-toolkit/issues/109&quot;&gt;found a reference&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/webmaxru&quot;&gt;Maxim Salnikov&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/webmaxru/pwa-guide-ngpoland/tree/step-dashboard&quot;&gt;PWA demo app&lt;/a&gt;. Maxim created this repo as part of a half-day workshop at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ng-poland.pl/&quot;&gt;ngPoland&lt;/a&gt; and the project’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; said to contact him for workshop instructions. I emailed Maxim and he politely shared his &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/pwa-ngpoland&quot;&gt;Angular 2 PWA Workshop instructions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.com/webmax/pwa-ngpoland#/&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Since then, Maxim as created a new guide called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/pwa-ng-nl&quot;&gt;Progressive Web Apps using the Angular Mobile Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transform-your-angular-app-to-be-a-pwa&quot;&gt;Transform your Angular App to be a PWA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of steps you need to perform to make the Angular client work offline and be a PWA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add Angular Material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create and register a Service Worker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create an App Shell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a manifest to make it installable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-angular-material&quot;&gt;Add Angular Material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.angular.io/&quot;&gt;Angular Material&lt;/a&gt; is not a necessary step, but it will make the client look much nicer. Make sure you’re in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; directory, then install it using npm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
npm install --save @angular/material@2.0.0-beta.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MaterialModule&lt;/code&gt; as an import in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;MaterialModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/material'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;MaterialModule&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Material icons and a theme to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'~https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'~@angular/material/core/theming/prebuilt/deeppurple-amber.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Roboto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the HTML templates to use Material components. For &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.html&lt;/code&gt;, you can change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to be an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-toolbar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-toolbar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{title}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-toolbar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;app-beer-list&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/app-beer-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-list.component.html&lt;/code&gt;, change it to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-list&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and its related components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Beer List&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-list-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let b of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;md-list-avatar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{b.giphyUrl}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{b.name}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;md-line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      {{b.name}}
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-list-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, the app should look a little better. Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; and you should see how your UI has changed. Below is a screenshot using Chrome’s device toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/angular-material-a31bcf74825026a6540cd78ed0e569461520388a424ecf0f533ce47225761ea8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Material&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that there’s still work to do, you’ll notice that if you toggle offline mode in the Network tab of Chrome’s developer tools, the app does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/offline-fails-06199cc55eb2460543d0a506342793de944430472f0ee3863f8b260a214587e4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Offline fails&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-and-register-a-service-worker&quot;&gt;Create and Register a Service Worker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a service worker, start by creating a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/sw.js&lt;/code&gt; file that logs when events have been triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'install'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Service Worker: Installed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'activate'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Service Worker: Active'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'fetch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Service Worker: Fetch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register this service worker by adding the following to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;defer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP&lt;/strong&gt;: If you have issues with pasting the JavaScript above into IntelliJ, you may need to set the default
JavaScript language version to ECMAScript 6. You can do this under &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Languages &amp;amp; Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt;
&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/intellij-javascript-es6-447107211c77f2f0a6f6f7a53ff4cbf686f48d594979f6ac3a28c1f5da0577fc.png&quot; alt=&quot;IntelliJ JavaScript version&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, you should see log messages in your console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/service-worker-logs-cfa29ca76ce5644d3a6df685dc63cd2a122cacb173c4812e9f5395ca3ecfa1ac.png&quot; alt=&quot;Service Worker logs&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also go to &lt;strong&gt;DevTools&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Service Workers&lt;/strong&gt; to see that it’s been registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/application-service-workers-829bbc28aed96aece7c9a6d982052198e492aff2726648a3759f9f17df2c1c0b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Service Workers&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure the service worker gets updated with each page refresh, check the “Update on reload” checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of adding PWA features to a webapp is to make sure it starts fast. To make this possible, you want to make sure all the resources are cached by the service worker and they’re sent to the page without a network request. To make this work, replace the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sw.js&lt;/code&gt; with the following file that caches local resources and network requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change and refreshing, you’ll notice that caches are created for both local assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/local-cache-fa097e2d52941a39fdec7d5d26aba11e7039fe8d91b8d1f59748858b3a0119a5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Local cache&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for network requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/network-cache-72a79fa5221703774c387ab696a0ac59c0ef515c6c7a26e3be3f9c3e342f78dc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Network cache&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-an-app-shell&quot;&gt;Create an App Shell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular App Shell is a project that provides &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shellRender&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shellNoRender&lt;/code&gt; directives. Using these directives, you can specify which parts of your app are included in an app shell. Start by installing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app-shell&lt;/code&gt; into your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @angular/app-shell --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AppShellModule&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; and specify it as an import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppShellModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/app-shell'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppShellModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to use app-shell’s directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-toolbar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{title}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/md-toolbar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;md-progress-bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;mode=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;indeterminate&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shellRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/md-progress-bar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shellNoRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;app-beer-list&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/app-beer-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-a-manifest-to-make-it-installable&quot;&gt;Add a Manifest to Make it Installable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step to making your app a PWA is to add a manifest that describes the application. This also enables the ability for people to install your app in Chrome as well as on smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://realfavicongenerator.net/&quot;&gt;Favicon Generator&lt;/a&gt; to generate graphic assets and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; file. For an app icon, I searched for “beer icons” and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/beer_168557#term=beer&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=26&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik&quot;&gt;Freepik&lt;/a&gt;. I generated a favicon, changed the generator options to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assets/favicons&lt;/code&gt; for the path, and downloaded the favicon package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;favicons.zip&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/assets/icons&lt;/code&gt; and add the following HTML to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;apple-touch-icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sizes=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;180x180&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/apple-touch-icon.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;image/png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sizes=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;32x32&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;image/png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/favicon-16x16.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sizes=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;16x16&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;manifest&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/manifest.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;mask-icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/safari-pinned-tab.svg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#5bbad5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;shortcut icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;msapplication-config&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;assets/icons/browserconfig.xml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;theme-color&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#ffffff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;viewport&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;image/x-icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assets/icons/manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; to add three additional properties: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;short_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;background_color&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start_url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;PWA Beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;short_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;icons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;src&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;sizes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;32x32&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;image/png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;src&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/icons/android-chrome-192x192.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;sizes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;192x192&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;image/png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;background_color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#ffa500&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;theme_color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#ffffff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;display&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;standalone&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;start_url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/index.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you refresh your app and Chrome doesn’t prompt you to install the app, you probably need to turn on a couple of features. Copy and paste the following URLs into Chrome to enable each feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chrome://flags/#enable-add-to-shelf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, you should see a prompt at the top of the screen to install the app. You can verify your manifest loaded correctly by going to &lt;strong&gt;DevTools&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Manifest&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/install-pwa-prompt-chrome-a1ca95b39f4629f126b3daa3146571974884ebaf5ed91b72731b6130d108db8e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Install PWA Prompt Chrome&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open Chrome developer tools &amp;gt; Network and enable offline, you’ll notice the app still loads when the user is offline. &lt;em&gt;Yippee!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/offline-works-ca2322bc134bc4fec73d8fb6bf2279d68d7f07ce2607db16e69f1f537a3f8e9b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Offline works&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;test-with-lighthouse&quot;&gt;Test with Lighthouse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk&quot;&gt;Lighthouse extension for Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and click its icon to audit your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/lighthouse-local-report-41178c3d3471cce95f4d573f44788f762daffffb6053daa4e08e26e890bc1836.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lighthouse PWA Report&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88 is a pretty good score, but you might notice that the app is not served over HTTPS. Deploying the app to a cloud provider can make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-the-cloud&quot;&gt;Deploy to the Cloud!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many cloud providers that support Spring Boot. For the Angular client, any web server will do since the app is full of static files after it’s been built. However, there are a couple things you’ll need to do to prepare the application for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.angular-cli.json&lt;/code&gt; to include the service worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;assets&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;assets&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;sw.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to use a different URL for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://pwa-server.cfapps.io/good-beers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; directory, run the following command to build and optimize for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng build -prod --aot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you hard-coded the paths to local files in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sw.js&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll need to update the paths to match the generated file names. Open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist/sw.js&lt;/code&gt; and change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*.bundle.js&lt;/code&gt; references in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;appShellFilesToCache&lt;/code&gt; array to match the file names in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; directory. Note that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;styles.bundle.js&lt;/code&gt; file reference should be changed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style.*.bundle.css&lt;/code&gt;. Later, I’ll show you how to automate this with a script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at how to deploy it on Cloud Foundry with &lt;a href=&quot;http://run.pivotal.io/&quot;&gt;Pivotal Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions below assume you have an account and have logged in (using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cf login&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy the client&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy a static application to Cloud Foundry is very easy. In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; directory, create an empty &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Staticfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch Staticfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands to push the client, set it to force HTTPs, then start it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You may have to change the name from “pwa-client” to a unique name that’s not being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cf push pwa-client --no-start
cf &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;-env pwa-client FORCE_HTTPS &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true
&lt;/span&gt;cf start pwa-client
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the deployed application in your browser (e.g. https://pwa-client.cfapps.io) and ensure it loads. If it does, you’ll likely have a 404 in its console for when it tries to access the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy the server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy the Spring Boot backend, you first need to add CORS configuration for the new client. In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController.java&lt;/code&gt;, change &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/code&gt; to the location of the deployed client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://pwa-client.cfapps.io&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, build the app and push it to Cloud Foundry. If you run the following commands from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; directory, all of this should happen for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mvn clean package
cf push -p target/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;jar pwa-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deploying to Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry, I ran a Lighthouse audit again and found my score to be 98/100. Not too shabby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot-pwa/lighthouse-prod-report-d792581e07f90c4acdf52874daa08bc9fc1e7f008dbe4b57448ec247a7cc0ea9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lighthouse Production Report&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automation&quot;&gt;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few steps involved to deploy this application and update files for production. For that reason, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-pwa-example/blob/master/deploy.sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; script that automates everything and uses random domain names for both servers. Note that it uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-pwa-example/blob/master/sw.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sw.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Python script to change the names of the script files in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist/sw.js&lt;/code&gt;. Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/starbuxman&quot;&gt;Josh Long&lt;/a&gt; for helping create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to use these scripts in your project, make sure to revert the changes for production URLs in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController.java&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code associated with this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-pwa-example&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you find any bugs, please file an issue, or post a question to Stack Overflow with the “okta” tag. Of course, you can always &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mraible&quot;&gt;ping me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently did a talk on Cloud Native PWAs at Devoxx France with Josh Long. The video below is a recording of that talk and shows me writing the same code that’s listed in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;max-width: 560px; margin: 0 auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xo7djiUBMpU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article showed you to convert an existing Angular application into a progressive web application and deploy it to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the recommendations in the Lighthouse report was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/http2&quot;&gt;use HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt;. In a future post, I’ll write about HTTP/2, what cloud providers support it, and how to deploy to the ones that do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to give a big thanks to all the engineers that’ve been developing progressive web apps and documenting how to do it. It’s new and exciting stuff, and may become the best way to write mobile applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seven Awesome New Features In Visual Studio 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft developers have been using Visual Studio for their IDE since before .NET was even a thing. Visual Studio is twenty years old this year, and on March 7th, 2017 Microsoft released the latest version of it’s flagship developer product, Visual Studio. With this release are a bunch of new features, improvements, and exciting changes for the beloved Microsoft developer environment. Here are seven features in the new IDE that will excite developers using the development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/seven-new-vs-features/vs-then-and-now-307b8c680186c918090d28ada7fe322487c87f2b55d69270dcd854f16686283d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Then And Now&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-editorconfig-built-in&quot;&gt;1. EditorConfig Built In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://editorconfig.org/&quot;&gt;EditorConfig project&lt;/a&gt; has been available for Visual Studio 2015, but it required you to install a plugin to take advantage of the code-style configuration tool. With the release of 2017, EditorConfig is now built into the IDE. This means you can simply create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of your solution and check it into your source control. This will get your whole team using the same code format rules (once you can all agree on what they should be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-new-visual-studio-installer&quot;&gt;2. New Visual Studio Installer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio 2017 also comes with a new installer. The new installer lets you put together an install of Visual Studio customized to the type of development you’re doing. You can install only the features you will need every day and leave out things that you might never need. This is a great way to keep the IDE small and snappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/seven-new-vs-features/vs-installer-344f671bae0108cafdc84b3b1631162724fb891d00d82c1494494e834ef54cf2.png&quot; alt=&quot;New Visual Studio Installer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-manage-visual-studio-performance&quot;&gt;3. Manage Visual Studio Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manage Visual Studio Performance (under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Help&lt;/code&gt; menu) allows you to view the performance of your Visual Studio IDE and can even give you suggestions about extensions that might be impacting the performance of your environment! This includes turning on Lightweight Solution Load, which doesn’t load all the projects in a solution when you open the solution, only when you begin to work in that project. You can still navigate through the code, but the project won’t be loaded until you actually start to work with that project. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/seven-new-vs-features/vs-perfromance-7c5e3623f9613e165efe2c4f6f1eb32776dca113d3811e9f9f11484db8b6f0e1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Manage Visual Studio Performance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-mobile-development&quot;&gt;4. Mobile Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft’s acquisition of Xamarin a few years ago, .NET developers have been enjoying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xamarin.com/&quot;&gt;Xamarin&lt;/a&gt; for free as &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Xamarin.Xamarin&quot;&gt;a plugin to Visual Studio 2015&lt;/a&gt;. In Visual Studio 2017, it’s now one of the install options when installing Visual Studio! This is a signal that cross-platform, mobile development is now a first-class citizen in your Microsoft development toolbelt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-live-unit-testing&quot;&gt;5. Live Unit Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing has been permeating every development stack over the last decade and Microsoft has followed the trend by making Live Unit Testing available. This means as you change your code, Visual Studio will let you know if your changes will break unit tests, or if they will not be covered by unit tests; in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running unit tests has almost always been an extra step of your development workflow, but with the Live Unit Testing indicators in your editor popping up as you edit code, it just happens. You can also click on an indicator in the editor and it will show you which tests are exercising that line of code. Unit testing for the win, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-better-javascript-support&quot;&gt;6. Better Javascript Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of Javascript and Javascript frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, and Vue, it’s no surprise that VSCode has really gleaned a lot of support from the developer community. VSCode has excellent support for Javascript (ES5 and ES6) as well as framework support for Angular and React, including JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/seven-new-vs-features/vs-javascript-support-3cad49103120e540c0bd40de199f70ca64843a397ba43082f269dfbadc4e01da.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Javascript Support&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on that win, Microsoft used the Javascript engine built into VSCode in Visual Studio 2017. This means that all the great support in VSCode is now available without switching out of your Visual Studio editor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-docker-support-built-in&quot;&gt;7. Docker Support Built-In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of containerization, microservices, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s own work with Docker&lt;/a&gt; to help support &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&amp;amp;isOfficial=0&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;pullCount=0&amp;amp;q=Microsoft+Windows&amp;amp;starCount=0&quot;&gt;Windows Containers&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no surprise that developers are looking for tighter integration with Docker for their development environments. In Visual Studio 2015 (Update 3), you could install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MicrosoftCloudExplorer.VisualStudioToolsforDocker-Preview&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Tools For Docker&lt;/a&gt; and get integrated support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; containers. Visual Studio 2017, builds this feature in and when choosing the application template from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;File -&amp;gt; New&lt;/code&gt; menu, you can choose to turn on Docker support, giving you all the goodness of the plug-in, built in to Visual Studio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/seven-new-vs-features/vs-docker-support-4a95842d59eb47b8d3c7c34c13496c4844e4f0b0e44dbdd15a75d3ff2d7cdbb4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Docker Support&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio has always been the editor of choice for those writing .NET applications and tapping into the Microsoft ecosystem. It has always had all the tools developers need to be their best, most productive selves. Now Microsoft has done some outstanding work to include and integrate with non-Microsoft tools that developers love to use, as well as help developers discover problems in their code, and improve the performance of their IDE. With the new additions and improvements in Visual Studio 2017, developers should love it even more!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and Angular</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To simplify development and deployment, you want everything in the same artifact, so you put your Angular app “inside” your Spring Boot app, right? But what if you could create your Angular app as a standalone app and make cross-origin requests to your API? Hey guess what, you can do both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that most frontend developers are used to having their apps standalone and making cross-origin requests to APIs. The beauty of having a client app that can point to a server app is you can point it to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; server and it makes it easy to test your current client code against other servers (e.g. test, staging, production).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post shows how you can have the best of both worlds where the UI and the API are separate apps. You’ll learn how to create REST endpoints with Spring Data REST, configure Spring Boot to allow CORS, and create an Angular app to display its data. This app will display a list of beers from the API, then fetch a GIF from &lt;a href=&quot;http://giphy.com&quot;&gt;https://giphy.com/&lt;/a&gt; that matches the beer’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to code along, feel free to grab the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-example&quot;&gt;source code from GitHub&lt;/a&gt;! You can also watch a video of this tutorial below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-an-api-with-spring-boot&quot;&gt;Build an API with Spring Boot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with Spring Boot, navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.spring.io&quot;&gt;start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt;. In the “Search for dependencies” field, select the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html&quot;&gt;DevTools&lt;/a&gt;: Provides auto-reloading of your application when files change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html&quot;&gt;H2&lt;/a&gt;: An in-memory database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html&quot;&gt;JPA&lt;/a&gt;: Standard ORM for Java&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/&quot;&gt;Rest Repositories&lt;/a&gt;: Allows you to expose your JPA repositories as REST endpoints&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-web/pom.xml&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;: Spring MVC with Jackson (for JSON), Hibernate Validator, and embedded Tomcat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot/start.spring-40481d4bc64d1e2aed423435516338966ff8be6ef51ee774ac6eef1124d02b0c.png&quot; alt=&quot;start.spring.io&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like the command-line better, you can use the following command to download a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;demo.zip&lt;/code&gt; file with &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpie.org/&quot;&gt;HTTPie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
dependencies==devtools,h2,data-jpa,data-rest,web -d
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a directory called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-angular-example&lt;/code&gt;, with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; directory inside it. Expand the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;demo.zip&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the “server” project in your favorite IDE and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DemoApplication&lt;/code&gt; or start it from the command line using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./mvnw spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;com.example.beer&lt;/code&gt; package and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beer.java&lt;/code&gt; file in it. This will be the entity that holds your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.persistence.Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.persistence.GeneratedValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.persistence.Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Entity&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Id&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GeneratedValue&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Beer{&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;id=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, name='&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/code&gt; class that leverages Spring Data to do CRUD on this entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerCommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; that uses this repository and creates a default set of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.stereotype.Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.stream.Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerCommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BeerCommandLineRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuild your project and you should see a list of beers printed in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot/beers-in-terminal-7b5dce7b41bc6a05c82d4926ca62561a98cc1e8a4227a3f0773eec7d02fa2342.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beers printed in terminal&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/rest/core/annotation/RepositoryRestResource.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@RepositoryRestResource&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; annotation to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/code&gt; to expose all its CRUD operations as REST endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RepositoryRestResource&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JpaRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/code&gt; class to create an endpoint that filters out less-than-great beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.HashMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.stream.Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BeerController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isGreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;isGreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Budweiser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Coors Light&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PBR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-build your application and navigate to http://localhost:8080/good-beers. You should see the list of good beers in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot/good-beers-json-1a0620eb2aba6bd33c1a3b59d600d0ce05dbad8f5fc86dab8e14865114ce50ea.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good Beers JSON&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also see this same result in your terminal window when using HTTPie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http localhost:8080/good-beers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-project-with-angular-cli&quot;&gt;Create a Project with Angular CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s cool that you created an API to display a list of beers, but APIs aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; cool without a UI. In this section, you’ll create a new Angular app, build services to fetch beers/images, and create components to display this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an Angular project, make sure you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#updating-angular-cli&quot;&gt;Angular CLI installed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng --version&lt;/code&gt; to confirm you’re using version 1.0.0 (or later). From a terminal window, cd into the root of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-boot-angular-example&lt;/code&gt; directory and run the following command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng new client
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; directory and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to install all the necessary dependencies. To verify everything works, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng e2e&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window. If everything works, you should see output like the following in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;09:02:35] I/direct - Using ChromeDriver directly...
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;09:02:35] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver

    ✓ should display message saying app works

Executed 1 of 1 spec SUCCESS &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;0.77 sec.
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;09:02:38] I/launcher - 0 instance&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; of WebDriver still running
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;09:02:38] I/launcher - chrome &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#01 passed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re just getting started with Angular, you might want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq3szz2KOOs&quot;&gt;watch this video of my recent Getting Started with Angular webinar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d rather not use the command line and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/&quot;&gt;WebStorm&lt;/a&gt;) installed, you can create a new Static Web Project and select Angular CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot/intellij-new-static-web-project-b7ff02752e212d0f02c6ed2b38776a1d62e89b24bad670388cd872e5ae76ab01.png&quot; alt=&quot;IntelliJ new Static Web project&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-beerlistcomponent-and-beerservice&quot;&gt;Create a BeerListComponent and BeerService&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, you’ve created a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;good-beers&lt;/code&gt; API and an Angular app, but you haven’t created the UI to display the list of beers from your API. To do this, create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;beer-list&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component by running Angular CLI’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;generate component&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng generate component beer-list
installing component
  create src/app/beer-list/beer-list.component.css
  create src/app/beer-list/beer-list.component.html
  create src/app/beer-list/beer-list.component.spec.ts
  create src/app/beer-list/beer-list.component.ts
  update src/app/app.module.ts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; alias for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; alias for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;component&lt;/code&gt;, so you can type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng g c beer-list&lt;/code&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/code&gt; service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng g s beer
installing service
  create src/app/beer.service.spec.ts
  create src/app/beer.service.ts
  WARNING Service is generated but not provided, it must be provided to be used
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/beer&lt;/code&gt; directory and move &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.*&lt;/code&gt; into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p src/app/shared/beer
mv src/app/beer.service.&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; src/app/shared/beer/.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/index.ts&lt;/code&gt; file and export the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt;. The reason for this file is so you can export multiple classes and import them in one line rather than multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./beer/beer.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; to call the “good-beers” API service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/http'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs/add/operator/map'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8080/good-beers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-list.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/code&gt; and store the results in a local variable. Notice that you need to add the service as a provider in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Component&lt;/code&gt; definition or you will see an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../shared'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'app-beer-list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./beer-list.component.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./beer-list.component.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerListComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-list.component.html&lt;/code&gt; so it renders the list of beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Beer List&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let b of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  {{b.name}}
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to have the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerListComponent&lt;/code&gt; rendered when you’re logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;app-beer-list&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/app-beer-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure both apps are started (with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt; in the server directory, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; in the client directory) and navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/a&gt;. You should see an error in your console that you means you have to configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8080/good-beers. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header
is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:4200' is therefore not allowed access.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this issue, you’ll need to configure Spring Boot to allow cross-domain access from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure-cors-for-spring-boot&quot;&gt;Configure CORS for Spring Boot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the server project, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerController.java&lt;/code&gt; and add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/code&gt; annotation to enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) from the client (http://localhost:4200).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/good-beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@CrossOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;goodBeers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, you should be able to see a list of beers from your Spring Boot API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-spring-boot/angular-beer-list-76c81e12896a4aeb2a3e8c5f0375bafa314c7275128cb22ac8f8e1db60df90cf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beer List in Angular&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it look a little better, add a &lt;a href=&quot;http://giphy.com&quot;&gt;Giphy&lt;/a&gt; service to fetch images based on the beer’s name. Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/giphy/giphy.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; and place the following code inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/http'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/front-end-javascript/getting-started-with-angular-2-by-building-a-giphy-search-application&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;


  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Public beta key: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#public-beta-key&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyApi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'//api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&amp;amp;q='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchTerm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;apiLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyApi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchTerm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;apiLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add an export for this class in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/index.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./beer/beer.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./giphy/giphy.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add it to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeerListComponent&lt;/code&gt; to set a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;giphyUrl&lt;/code&gt; on each &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../shared'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'app-beer-list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./beer-list.component.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GiphyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerListComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BeerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;giphyUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beer-list.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to include a reference to this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let b of beers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  {{b.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;200&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{b.giphyUrl}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{b.name}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result should look something like the following list of beer names with images.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Angular Authentication with OpenID Connect and Okta in 20 Minutes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Angular (formerly called Angular 2.0) is quickly becoming one of the most powerful ways to build a modern single-page app. A core strength is Angular’s focus on building reusable components, which help you decouple the various concerns in your application. Take authentication, for example: it can be painful to build, but once you wrap it in a component, the authentication logic can be reused throughout your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Angular CLI makes it easy to scaffold new components, and even entire projects. If you haven’t used the Angular CLI to quickly generate Angular code, you’re in for a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, you’ll build a simple web application with Angular CLI, a tool for Angular development. You’ll create an application with search and edit features, then add authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-angular-application&quot;&gt;Create an Angular Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIP: If you’d like to skip building the Angular application and get right to adding authentication, you can clone my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-demo&lt;/code&gt; project, then skip to the &lt;a href=&quot;#create-open-id-connect-app&quot;&gt;Create an OpenID Connect App in Okta&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/mraible/ng-demo.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-youll-need&quot;&gt;What You’ll Need&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 20 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A favorite text editor or IDE. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and npm installed. I recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/creationix/nvm&quot;&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.angular.io/&quot;&gt;Angular CLI&lt;/a&gt; installed. If you don’t have Angular CLI installed, install it using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install -g @angular/cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new project using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng new&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng new ng-demo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-demo&lt;/code&gt; project and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; in it. It should take about a minute to complete, but that could vary depending on your connection speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;mraible:~/dev] &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng new ng-demo

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-your-angular-application&quot;&gt;Run Your Angular Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is configured with &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html&quot;&gt;webpack dev server&lt;/a&gt;. To start it, make sure you’re in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-demo&lt;/code&gt; directory, then run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see a screen like the one below at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make sure your new project’s tests pass, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng test&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-a-search-feature&quot;&gt;Add a Search Feature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a search feature, open the project in an IDE or your favorite text editor. For IntelliJ IDEA, use File &amp;gt; New Project &amp;gt; Static Web and point to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-demo&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a terminal window, cd into your project’s directory and run the following command. This will create a search component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng g component search

  create src/app/search/search.component.css
  create src/app/search/search.component.html
  create src/app/search/search.component.spec.ts
  create src/app/search/search.component.ts
  update src/app/app.module.ts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/search/search.component.html&lt;/code&gt; and replace its default HTML with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Search&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;search&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;query&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;keyup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;enter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Search&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{searchResults | json}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html&quot;&gt;Router documentation&lt;/a&gt; for Angular provides the information you need to setup a route to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/code&gt; you just generated. Here’s a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;, add an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/code&gt; constant and import it in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@NgModule&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;RouterModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/router'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'search'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/search'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pathMatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'full'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;RouterModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/app.component.html&lt;/code&gt;, add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RouterOutlet&lt;/code&gt; to display routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;router-outlet&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/router-outlet&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have routing setup, you can continue writing the search feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; running, your browser should refresh automatically. If not, navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/a&gt;, and you should see the search form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/search-without-css-664524fe9f5061f8c27851eace27912fa88caa8f999f06b8840ac1b2e21965a2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search component&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to add CSS for this components, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/search/search.component.css&lt;/code&gt; and add some CSS. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section has shown you how to generate a new component to a basic Angular application with Angular CLI. The next section will show you how to create a use a JSON file and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; to create a fake API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get search results, create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/code&gt; that makes HTTP requests to a JSON file. Start by generating a new service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng g service search
installing service
  create src/app/search.service.spec.ts
  create src/app/search.service.ts
  WARNING Service is generated but not provided, it must be provided to be used
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move the generated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; and its test to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app/shared/search&lt;/code&gt;. You’ll need to create this directory. Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/assets/data/people.json&lt;/code&gt; to hold your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Peyton Manning&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;phone&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;(303) 567-8910&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;street&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;1234 Main Street&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;city&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Greenwood Village&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;CO&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;phone&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;(917) 323-2333&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;street&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;14 Mountain Way&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;city&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Vail&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;CO&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;81657&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/search/search.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; and provide &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency in its constructor. In this same file, create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getAll()&lt;/code&gt; method to gather all the people. Also, define the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; classes that JSON will be marshalled to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/http'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs/add/operator/map'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'assets/data/people.json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make these classes available for consumption by your components, edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/index.ts&lt;/code&gt; and add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./search/search.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for creating this file is so you can import multiple classes on a single line rather than having to import each individual class on separate lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search.component.ts&lt;/code&gt;, add imports for these classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../shared'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;searchResults&lt;/code&gt; variables. While you’re there, modify the constructor to inject the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;searchResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then implement a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt; method to call the service’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getAll()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchResults&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you’ll likely see the following message in your browser’s console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ORIGINAL EXCEPTION: No provider for SearchService!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix the “No provider” error from above, update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/code&gt;
and add the service to the list of providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./shared'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./app.component.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;viewProviders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now clicking the search button should work. To make the results look better, remove the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and replace it with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/search/search.component.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;searchResults&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Name&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Phone&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Address&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngFor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;let person of searchResults; let i=index&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{person.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{person.phone}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{person.address.street}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      {{person.address.city}}, {{person.address.state}} {{person.address.zip}}
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add some additional CSS in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/search/search.component.css&lt;/code&gt; to improve its table layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-collapse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;collapse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#ddd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;td&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#ddd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the search results look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/search-results-5564a373ca4b9e85d624289b73d10a486e9ac214ce23d09929fb0dfa42365856.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search Results&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, you still don’t have search functionality! To add a search feature, add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt; method to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'*'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then refactor &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/code&gt; to call this method with its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchResults&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now search results will be filtered by the query value you type in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section showed you how to fetch and display search results. The next section builds on this and shows how to edit and save a record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-an-edit-feature&quot;&gt;Add an Edit Feature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to add a link for editing a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;routerLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]=&quot;['/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;',&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{person.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to generate an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EditComponent&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng g component edit
installing component
  create src/app/edit/edit.component.css
  create src/app/edit/edit.component.html
  create src/app/edit/edit.component.spec.ts
  create src/app/edit/edit.component.ts
  update src/app/app.module.ts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a route for this component in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'search'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'edit/:id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;EditComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/search'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pathMatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'full'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/edit/edit.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to display an editable form. You might notice I’ve added &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attributes to most elements. This is to make things easier when writing integration tests with Protractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;person&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{editName}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Id:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {{person.id}}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Name:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Phone:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editPhone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;phone&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;phone&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Phone&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;fieldset&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;legend&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Address:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/legend&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;street&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;city&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;,

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/address&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'person'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'person'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'person'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add CSS to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/edit/edit.component.css&lt;/code&gt; if you want to make the form look a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should be able to search for a person and update their information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/edit-form-9e8118d51384c2d0f5e20f464da2bad40278f750311e2f002de265cf403edcb9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edit form&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/edit/edit.component.html&lt;/code&gt; calls a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt; function to update a person’s data. You already implemented this above.
The function calls a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gotoList()&lt;/code&gt; function that appends the person’s name to the URL when sending the user back to the search screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gotoList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/search'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/search'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t execute a search automatically when you execute this URL, add the following logic to do so in its constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ActivatedRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/router'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Subscription&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rxjs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Subscription&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;searchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ActivatedRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'term'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;decodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'term'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to implement &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/code&gt; and define the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngOnDestroy&lt;/code&gt; method to clean up this subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngOnDestroy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;unsubscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making all these changes, you should be able to search/edit/update a person’s information. If it works - nice job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;form-validation&quot;&gt;Form Validation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you might notice is you can clear any input element in the form and save it. At the very least, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field should be required. Otherwise, there’s nothing to click on in the search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make name required, modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edit.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;required&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the name &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to wrap everything in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and close it before the last &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You’ll also need to add an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(ngSubmit)&lt;/code&gt; handler to the form and change the save button to be a regular submit button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{editName}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;()&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngNativeValidate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;submit&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Save&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;()&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cancel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Cancel&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, any field with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;required&lt;/code&gt; attribute will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/edit-form-validation-8fa28d60c24ace53ee83db37b94d719a9d8c6772d99a07131d43b6bc063b5774.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edit form with validation&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot, you might notice the address fields are blank. This is explained by the error in your console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;If ngModel is used within a form tag, either the name attribute must be set or the form
control must be defined as 'standalone' in ngModelOptions.

Example 1: &amp;lt;input [(ngModel)]=&quot;person.firstName&quot; name=&quot;first&quot;&amp;gt;
Example 2: &amp;lt;input [(ngModel)]=&quot;person.firstName&quot; [ngModelOptions]=&quot;{standalone: true}&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix, add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute to all the address fields. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;street&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;street&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;city&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;city&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;size=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;editAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;size=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/address&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now values should display in all fields and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; should be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/edit-form-names-bf02d6ef39bff4a672ff4323df488fa0be1d10e889a1d5dc0e8cba4b5ec74b05.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edit form with names and validation&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Angular 2, this is all you’ll need to do. However, with Angular 4+, you need to a little more work to stop the form from submitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To display HTML5 validation messages, add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngNativeValidate&lt;/code&gt; directive to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to provide your own validation messages:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#editForm=&quot;ngForm&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#name=&quot;ngModel&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input id=&quot;name&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[disabled]=&quot;!editForm.form.valid&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Save&lt;/em&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add the following under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field to display a validation error.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;]=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;valid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pristine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;color: red&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Name is required
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about forms and validation, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html&quot;&gt;Angular forms documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;create-open-id-connect-app&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-openid-connect-app-in-okta&quot;&gt;Create an OpenID Connect App in Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user and, as well as to obtain their basic profile information. To learn more, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://openid.net/connect/&quot;&gt;https://openid.net/connect/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To integrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt; for user authentication, you’ll first need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; and create an OIDC application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login to your Okta account, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/&quot;&gt;create one&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have one. Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Admin &amp;gt; Add Applications&lt;/strong&gt; and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Create New App&lt;/strong&gt; button. Select &lt;strong&gt;Single Page App (SPA)&lt;/strong&gt; for the Platform and &lt;strong&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/strong&gt; for the sign on method. Click the &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; button and give your application a name. On the next screen, add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/code&gt; as a Redirect URI and click &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;. You should see settings like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/oidc-settings-ec21ae1ecd7a70f68b887fa6ecf3daeb4f8f82e2f80328a2009272ff8b2c1c02.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC App Settings&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt; tab and the &lt;strong&gt;Assign to People&lt;/strong&gt; button. Assign yourself as a user, or someone else that you know the credentials for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manfredsteyer&quot;&gt;Manfred Steyer’s&lt;/a&gt; project to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc&quot;&gt;add OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect support&lt;/a&gt; using npm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save angular-oauth2-oidc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; to import &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/code&gt; and configure your app to use your Okta application settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'angular-oauth2-oidc'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;redirectUri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[client-id]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'openid profile email'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oidc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;issuer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://dev-[dev-id].oktapreview.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loadDiscoveryDocument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tryLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, you should be able to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; and see a login button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/okta-login-button-6945f18dd8e5eeb22be1d87785578f827769fc3ad2881b94a282a98c87db1363.png&quot; alt=&quot;Login button&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt; button and sign-in with one of the people that’s configured in your Okta application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/okta-login-form-12ee55c95cbbca0f863e611f9d876968e5d5298101ad7b453ef171b8725573fd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Okta Login form&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After logging in, you’ll be able to click &lt;em&gt;Search&lt;/em&gt; and view people’s information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/okta-post-login-638b4111e0d2fb1f04f9db2da3aa5857de970bf0b33c5b54e7854f5a0856c53f.png&quot; alt=&quot;View after login&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it works - great! If you want to build your own login form in your app, continue reading to learn how to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js&quot;&gt;Okta Auth SDK&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authentication-with-the-okta-auth-sdk&quot;&gt;Authentication with the Okta Auth SDK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Okta Auth SDK builds on top of Otka’s &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/api/resources/authn.html&quot;&gt;Authentication API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/api/resources/oidc.html&quot;&gt;OAuth 2.0 API&lt;/a&gt; to enable you to create a fully branded sign-in experience using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it using npm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @okta/okta-auth-js --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a reference to this library’s main JavaScript file in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.angular-cli.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;../node_modules/@okta/okta-auth-js/dist/okta-auth-js.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The components in this section use Bootstrap CSS classes. Add a reference to Bootstrap’s CSS in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt; to declare &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OktaAuth&lt;/code&gt; and modify its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; so it has a button to login, as well as a sign-in form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaAuth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngIf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;givenName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt; should render as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-oidc/sign-in-form-e80bc5e512db14150307ec1395c35b8032288458363afb1acda6bcde3f08ccde.png&quot; alt=&quot;Custom sign-in form&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import Angular’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt;, add it as a dependency in the constructor, and add local variables for the username and password fields. Then implement a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loginWithPassword()&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/code&gt;. This method uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OktaAuth&lt;/code&gt; library to get a session token and exchange it for ID and access tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/router'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HomeComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OAuthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loginWithPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oauthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createAndSaveNonce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nonce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;signIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'SUCCESS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to sign in using the form, using one of your app’s registered users. After logging in, you’ll be able to click the &lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt; link and view people’s information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build a React Application with User Authentication in 15 Minutes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;React has quickly become one of the most favored front-end web frameworks, and is second only to plain old HTML5, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.com/technology-trends-2017-top-frameworks-131993.html&quot;&gt;according to JAXenter&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s no surprise that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lynda.com/React-js-training-tutorials/7049-0.html&quot;&gt;developers are learning it&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&amp;amp;q=ReactJS&quot;&gt;employers are asking for it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you’ll start with a very simple React app with a couple of pages and some routing built in, and add authentication using &lt;a href=&quot;/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget&quot;&gt;Okta’s Sign-In Widget&lt;/a&gt;. The Sign-In Widget is an embeddable Javascript widget that allows developers to use Okta’s secure, scalable architecture with a minimum of effort from within React applications. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-the-simple-react-seed-project&quot;&gt;Get the Simple React Seed Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by cloning the simple React seed project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/leebrandt/simple-react-seed.git okta-react-widget-sample
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;okta-react-widget-sample
npm install
npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt;, you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/react-sign-in-widget/React-Simple-Seed-Screener-34adf969ca5df9fb4ea332863417ef441ae4525f30a144c002ad23a31594c816.png&quot; alt=&quot;Running Seed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click on the navigation links, you should see page placeholders for those links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-the-okta-sign-in-widget&quot;&gt;Add the Okta Sign-In Widget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget&quot;&gt;Okta Sign-In Widget&lt;/a&gt; using NPM. We’ll be using version 1.9.0 of the Sign-In Widget, which is the most recent version at the time of this writing. Note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/191&quot;&gt;using Yarn won’t work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @okta/okta-signin-widget@1.9.0 --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will add the Okta Sign-In Widget code to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/react-sign-in-widget/Okta-Widget-NPM-Modules-Screener-793639e55e4967b968ae363f1af37e4f1ec426d08fb0fe2ea7300459d84d3c87.png&quot; alt=&quot;Okta in node_modules&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add the styles for the widget in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file from the Okta CDN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://ok1static.oktacdn.com/assets/js/sdk/okta-signin-widget/1.9.0/css/okta-sign-in.min.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Theme file: Customize or replace this file if you want to override our default styles --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://ok1static.oktacdn.com/assets/js/sdk/okta-signin-widget/1.9.0/css/okta-theme.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-loginpage-component&quot;&gt;The LoginPage Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, create a folder called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;auth&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./src/components&lt;/code&gt; folder, then create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoginPage.js&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/code&gt; component will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the most basic of components&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little component doesn’t &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; much but at least you now have a handle to add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/code&gt; to your routing. So in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./src/app.js&lt;/code&gt; file, you’ll import the component with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./components/auth/LoginPage'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then add the route inside the main route (the one with the path of “/”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/login&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-the-openid-connect-application-in-okta&quot;&gt;Add the OpenID Connect Application in Okta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; Okta as your OpenID Connect provider for authentication, you’ll need to set up an application in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com&quot;&gt;Okta developer portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So log in to your Okta account, [or create one](https://developer.okta.com] if you haven’t yet. Navigate to Admin &amp;gt; Add Applications and click on the Create New App button. Select Single Page App (SPA) for Platform and OpenID Connect for the sign on method. Click the Create button and give your application a name. On the next screen, add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt; as a Redirect URI and click Finish. You should see settings like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/react-sign-in-widget/Okta-Developer-Portal-OIDC-App-Screener-757b218884250a613b267c5d2c0b2a01292d96efd85a0c0706cc50e39ac6779d.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC Application Settings&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make note of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Client ID&lt;/code&gt; (yours shouldn’t be blurred out) and make note of your Dev ID (it’s the number part of your subdomain of the URL) So if you are at https://dev-1234-admin.oktapreview.com/… your Dev ID is 1234.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have that, you can set up the widget to talk to your new app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-the-widget-to-your-component&quot;&gt;Add the Widget to Your Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@okta/okta-signin-widget'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://dev-[dev id].oktapreview.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[client id]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:3000'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far you’ve imported the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/code&gt; function from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget&quot;&gt;Okta Sign-In Widget&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; module you installed earlier. Next, in the constructor of the component, you initialized an instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/code&gt; with the configuration for the application. This way, the application code will be able to talk to Okta and Okta will recognize that this is the app you just created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-the-login-widget&quot;&gt;Show The Login Widget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you’ll create the code to actually render the Sign-In Widget to the page! You’ll need to change your render method to create an HTML element  you can render the widget into. Make sure to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html&quot;&gt;reference to the element&lt;/a&gt; that will be rendered. Then, add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; function to make sure you don’t try to render the widget before the HTML element is on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@okta/okta-signin-widget'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://dev-[dev id].oktapreview.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[client id]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:3000'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;authParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;responseType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'id_token'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;renderEl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loginContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loginContainer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also added state to your component. If you’re using a flux implementation, this would naturally come from the app state. But to keep this tutorial simple, let your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/code&gt; keep track of it’s own state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-whether-the-user-is-logged-in&quot;&gt;Check Whether the User is Logged In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re almost there, but you don’t necessarily want to render the widget right away. You’ll need to add a check to make sure the user isn’t already logged in, and move your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;renderEl&lt;/code&gt; out to a function called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...other stuff removed for brevity's sake&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'INACTIVE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might have noticed a weird bit of code in that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/code&gt; method. That first line: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Backbone.history.stop()&lt;/code&gt;. The widget itself uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://backbonejs.org/&quot;&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; to navigate between its own screens (login, forgot password, etc.), and when it renders, it starts the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Backbone.history&lt;/code&gt;. Since you’ve now moved it out into a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/code&gt; function, the widget is going to re-render whenever the function is called. So this is just a little trick to tell Backbone to stop the history, because it’s going to restart when the widget is rendered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-final-loginpage-react-component&quot;&gt;The Final LoginPage React Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s wrap this up. Make sure you bind the class’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; context to each of your methods. Add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;logout&lt;/code&gt; method, and change your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method to make a decision on what to render, based on whether there is a currently logged in user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the final version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoginPage.js&lt;/code&gt; should look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@okta/okta-signin-widget'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://dev-[dev id].oktapreview.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loginContainer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-it-out&quot;&gt;Check It Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run the app now (with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;), you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/react-sign-in-widget/Finished-Sample-Screener-ae69f53d352922d2ecd2a2baaf83b111defd6ce5b025952b7a4bcd9ce11fafae.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Finished Sample&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it works - congrats! If it doesn’t, please post a question to Stack Overflow with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta&quot;&gt;okta tag&lt;/a&gt;, or hit me up on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leebrandt&quot;&gt;@leebrandt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one known issue in this tutorial. The widget’s CSS takes over the whole page and will override your app’s CSS. This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/126&quot;&gt;documented issue&lt;/a&gt; and you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta&quot;&gt;Matt Raible’s comment on it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;react--okta&quot;&gt;React + Okta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a completed version of the application created in this blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leebrandt/okta-react-widget-sample&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building authentication in an application is hard. It’s even less fun to build it over and over again in each application you build. Okta does the hard part for you and makes it a lot more fun to be a developer! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/&quot;&gt;Sign up for a forever-free developer account&lt;/a&gt; and try Okta today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve enjoyed this quick tour of our React support. If you have questions about Okta’s features, or what we’re building next, please hit me up on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leebrandt&quot;&gt;@leebrandt&lt;/a&gt;, leave a comment below, or open an issue on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build an Angular App with Okta's Sign-In Widget in 15 Minutes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;AngularJS reigned as king of JavaScript MVC frameworks for several years. However, when the Angular team announced they would not provide backwards compatibility for their next version, there was a bit of a stir in its community, giving opportunities for frameworks like React and Vue.js to flourish. Fast forward a few years and both Angular 2 and Angular 4 have been released. Many developers are trying its TypeScript and finding the experience a pleasant one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.com/technology-trends-2017-top-frameworks-131993.html&quot;&gt;According to JAXenter&lt;/a&gt;, it’s doing a pretty good job, and holding strong as the third most popular UI framework, behind React and HTML5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’ll show you a quick way to get started with Angular, and add user authentication with &lt;a href=&quot;/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget&quot;&gt;Okta’s Sign-In Widget&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re just getting started with Angular, you might want to read my &lt;a href=&quot;http://gist.asciidoctor.org/?github-mraible/ng-demo//README.adoc&quot;&gt;Angular tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like to get the source code used in this article, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-sign-in-widget-example&quot;&gt;find it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-user-authentication-with-okta&quot;&gt;Why User Authentication with Okta?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okta provides an API service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. We make user account management easier, more secure, and scalable so you can get to production sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget_ref&quot;&gt;Okta Sign-in Widget&lt;/a&gt; provides an embeddable JavaScript sign-in implementation that can be easily customized. The Sign-in Widget carries the same feature set in the standard Okta sign-in page of every tenant – with the added flexibility to change the look-and-feel. Included in the widget is support for password reset, forgotten password and strong authentication – all of which are driven by policies configured in Okta. Developers don’t have to write a single line of code to trigger these functions from within the widget. For consumer facing sites, social providers are also supported in the widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-angular-application&quot;&gt;Create an Angular Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular 4 was &lt;a href=&quot;http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html&quot;&gt;recently released&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100-2017-03-24&quot;&gt;Angular CLI 1.0&lt;/a&gt;. To see how you might use Okta’s Sign-In Widget in a simple Angular application, create a new application with Angular CLI. First, you’ll need to install Angular CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g @angular/cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this command completes, you can create a new application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;mraible:~] &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ng new angular-okta-example

You can &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ng &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; --global &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;packageManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;yarn&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular-okta-example&lt;/code&gt; directory and install all the necessary dependencies. To verify everything works, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng e2e&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window. All tests should pass and you should see results like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-sign-in-widget/e2e-success-035a935c9ccea2ebfb97f06b4a7c44846df05279e3cf246b545cf20e27c34dcb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Running e2e&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;integrate-oktas-sign-in-widget-in-angular&quot;&gt;Integrate Okta’s Sign-In Widget in Angular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to leverage Okta’s Sign-In Widget for an easily customizable login view. To start, install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget&quot;&gt;Okta Sign-In Widget&lt;/a&gt; using npm. Note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/191&quot;&gt;using Yarn won’t work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save @okta/okta-signin-widget
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the widget’s CSS to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/styles.css&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'~@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'~@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-theme.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the widget’s JavaScript file to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.angular-cli.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;../node_modules/@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/js/okta-sign-in.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/shared/okta/okta.service.ts&lt;/code&gt; and use it to wrap the widget’s configuration and make it an injectable service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://dev-{YOUR-ID}.oktapreview.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{CLIENT_ID}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;redirectUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:4200'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getWidget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this service available to all components in the application, modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; and list &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/code&gt; as a provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./shared/okta/okta.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nraboy&quot;&gt;Nic Raboy&lt;/a&gt; for teaching me that it’s pretty easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/javascript-libraries-in-a-typescript-application-revisited/&quot;&gt;include JavaScript libraries in a TypeScript application&lt;/a&gt;. The key is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/code&gt; statement in the code above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this will work, you’ll need to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application in Okta so you can replace the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;YOUR_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;CLIENT_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; references when initializing the widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-openid-connect-app-in-okta&quot;&gt;Create an OpenID Connect App in Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenID Connect is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user and, as well as to obtain their basic profile information. To learn more, see http://openid.net/connect/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login to your Okta account, or create one at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com&quot;&gt;https://developer.okta.com&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have one. Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Admin &amp;gt; Add Applications&lt;/strong&gt; and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Create New App&lt;/strong&gt; button. Select &lt;strong&gt;Single Page App (SPA)&lt;/strong&gt; for the Platform and &lt;strong&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/strong&gt; for the sign on method. Click the &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; button and give your application a name. On the next screen, add &lt;strong&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/strong&gt; as a Redirect URI and click &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;. You should see settings like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-sign-in-widget/oidc-settings-5e9f630db270b1c886a5cddd3524f6ccca8889efe98e6c04608f0373bb096b91.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC App Settings&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt; tab and the &lt;strong&gt;Assign to People&lt;/strong&gt; button. Assign yourself as a user, or someone else that you know the credentials for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-the-sign-in-widget&quot;&gt;Show the Sign-In Widget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, copy the your Client ID and Platform ID into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;okta.service.ts&lt;/code&gt;. Then modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.ts&lt;/code&gt; to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/code&gt; service and the widget to login/logout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./shared/okta/okta.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'SUCCESS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oktaSignIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;signOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showLogin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.component.html&lt;/code&gt; to have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id=&quot;okta-login-container&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and a place to show the logged in user’s email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;!user&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;okta-login-container&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Hello {{user}}

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Logout&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt;, and open your browser to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/a&gt;. You should see the sign-in widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-sign-in-widget/sign-in-widget-285f593cea19908cff0537c49927c95741eb956697d0501e2ef594054166017e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sign-In Widget&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you look at your browser’s console, you’ll likely see an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://dev-158606.oktapreview.com/api/v1/sessions/me. Response to
preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:4200' is therefore not allowed access.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens when Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not enabled. To enable it, go to your Okta Admin Dashboard,
select &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Trusted Origins&lt;/strong&gt;. Click the “Add Origin” button and specify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4200&lt;/code&gt;
as the Origin URL with Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/code&gt;. For more specific instructions, see Okta’s &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/api/getting_started/enabling_cors.html&quot;&gt;Enabling CORS documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-sign-in-widget/cors-configuration-3ea19bdd525497544ceed789e84628e14586c0d314c8890025671155004a8264.png&quot; alt=&quot;CORS Configuration&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change, enter an assigned person’s credentials to login. You should see a “Hello {email}” message with a logout button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-sign-in-widget/login-success-08bf3dff5a3f0ed1be087d0d5e2da037d3b52c875027f84764dcea7ab42b18f6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Login Success&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You may experience an issue where the sign-in process seems to hang. Clicking anywhere in the browser window seems to solve this problem. I’m not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it works - congrats! If it doesn’t, please post a question to Stack Overflow with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta&quot;&gt;okta tag&lt;/a&gt;, or hit me up &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mraible&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of known issues in this tutorial. The first is that the widget’s CSS takes over the whole page and will override your app’s CSS. This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/126&quot;&gt;documented issue&lt;/a&gt; and you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/issues/126#issuecomment-286530056&quot;&gt;my comment on it&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Logout&lt;/strong&gt; button doesn’t re-render the Sign-In Widget. You can do a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;location.reload()&lt;/code&gt; after logging out, but I’m guessing there’s a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To workaround the first issue, you can remove the global CSS files from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt; and add CSS that only affects the widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;customize-the-widget-css&quot;&gt;Customize the Widget CSS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the CSS &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/code&gt; statements to added to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/styles.css&lt;/code&gt;. Add an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap 4&lt;/a&gt; and a few style rules to position elements. Copy the following code into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/styles.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url(https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.6/css/bootstrap.min.css)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#okta-login-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;400px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;silver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;silver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#okta-login-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#okta-login-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these changes, the sign-in widget will look like the following screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/angular-sign-in-widget/custom-css-f5c0f69d07cf9db0d464ba70c5b452f599e9194ab8c4b126d4ba62a26300baac.png&quot; alt=&quot;Custom CSS&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fix-your-tests&quot;&gt;Fix Your Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng test&lt;/code&gt;, tests will fail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chrome 56.0.2924 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Mac OS X 10.11.6&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: Executed 3 of 3 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;3 FAILED&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0 secs / 0.181 secs&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
Chrome 56.0.2924 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Mac OS X 10.11.6&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; AppComponent should render title &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;a h1 tag FAILED
	Failed: No provider &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;Okta!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, specify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/code&gt; as a provider in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/app/app.component.spec.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./shared/okta/okta.service'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'AppComponent'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beforeEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TestBed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;configureTestingModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Okta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;compileComponents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this changes, you should see the sweet smell of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chrome 56.0.2924 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Mac OS X 10.11.6&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;8.562 secs / 7.479 secs&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protractor tests should still work as well. You can prove this by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng e2e&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;angular--okta&quot;&gt;Angular + Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a completed version of the application created in this blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-sign-in-widget-example&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. In a future post, I’ll show you how to create a more Angular-native experience, where you control the HTML for the login form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building authentication in an application is hard. It’s even less fun to build it over and over again in each application you build. Okta does the hard part for you and makes it a lot more fun to be a developer! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/&quot;&gt;Sign up for a forever-free developer account and try Okta today!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve enjoyed this quick tour of our Angular support. If you have questions about Okta’s features, or what we’re building next, please hit me up &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mraible&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta&quot;&gt;post a question to Stack Overflow with an “okta” tag&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-sign-in-widget-example/issues/new&quot;&gt;open a new issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Get Started with Spring Boot, OAuth 2.0, and Okta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re building a Spring Boot application, you’ll eventually need to add user authentication. You can do this with OAuth 2.0 (henceforth: OAuth). OAuth is a standard that applications can use to provide client applications with “secure delegated access”. It works over HTTP and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very simply, OAuth is a protocol that supports authorization workflows. It gives you a way to ensure that a specific user has specific permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAuth doesn’t validate a user’s identity — that’s taken care of by an authentication service like Okta. Authentication is when you validate a user’s identity (like asking for a username / password to log in), whereas authorization is when you check to see what permissions an existing user already has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial you’ll build an OAuth client for a Spring Boot application, plus add authentication with the Okta Platform API. You can sign up for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/&quot;&gt;forever-free Okta developer account here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to code along, feel free to grab the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-oauth-example&quot;&gt;source code from GitHub&lt;/a&gt;! You can also watch a video of this tutorial below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rix3f3k64hI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started-with-spring-cloud&quot;&gt;Get Started with Spring Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Security is a project from the good folks at Pivotal that “offers a set of primitives for building secure applications and services with minimum fuss”. Not only is it easy to use in platforms like Cloud Foundry, but it builds on Spring Boot, Spring Security, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oauth.com/&quot;&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt;. Because it builds on OAuth, it’s easy to integrate it with an authentication API like Okta’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spring Cloud Security project includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-security/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/quickstart.adoc&quot;&gt;great quickstart&lt;/a&gt; that will help you get started with very few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-secure-spring-boot-app&quot;&gt;Create a Secure Spring Boot App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a Spring Boot application is dirt simple if you use the Spring CLI. It allows you to write Groovy scripts that get rid of the boilerplate Java and build file configuration. This allows you, the developer, to focus on the necessary code. Refer to the project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli&quot;&gt;official documentation for installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;. To install Spring CLI, I recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-sdkman-cli-installation&quot;&gt;SDKMAN!&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sdk install springboot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-homebrew-cli-installation&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; if you’re on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew tap pivotal/tap
brew install springboot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;helloWorld.groovy&lt;/code&gt; file that has a Controller in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-groovy highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Grab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'spring-boot-starter-security'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hello World'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Grab&lt;/code&gt; annotation invokes &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/a&gt; to download dependencies and having Spring Security in the classpath causes its default security rules to be used. That is, protect everything, allow a user with the username &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;, and generate a random password on startup for said user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this app with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;spring run helloGroovy.groovy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll be prompted to login with your browser’s basic authentication dialog. Enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; for the username and copy/paste the generated password from your console. If you copied and pasted the password successfully, you’ll see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/code&gt; in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/0-hello-world-c9f0b9b0afcaed45b245902ea4e5ce68f0c8f1caf85b8c7d69d9d7e7078363dc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-authorization-server-in-okta&quot;&gt;Create an Authorization Server in Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start authenticating against Okta’a API, you have to first create a developer account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com&quot;&gt;https://developer.okta.com&lt;/a&gt;. After activating your account, sign in and navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;gt; API&lt;/strong&gt; and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Add Authorization Server&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/1-add-auth-server-a7f86ce0c69a220e33d69e3e83e489f0152c7f29deaa28af6050f90e23c678b8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Authorization Server&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the name and Resource URI of your choosing. The names aren’t important at this time. I used the following values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; Oktamus Prime&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource URI:&lt;/strong&gt; http://authenticat.is.easy/withokta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/2-auth-server-settings-3793ada4e1acd8314634d68433d3a9cfa7a5a9e90e8ebaeae4639d22039ab934.png&quot; alt=&quot;Authorization Server Settings&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metadata URI you see in this screenshot will come in handy later when you need to specify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accessTokenUri&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;userAuthorizationUri&lt;/code&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-openid-connect-app-in-okta&quot;&gt;Create an OpenID Connect App in Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a client id and secret, you need to create a new OpenID Connect (OIDC) app. Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Applications &amp;gt; Add Application&lt;/strong&gt; and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Create New App&lt;/strong&gt; button. The application name isn’t important, you can use whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/4-oidc-name-4f222609905faa168bb21796260232ac117dd5bf97ac1da441d5b0d02dced208.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC App Name&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; to configure OIDC. Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; as a Redirect URI and click &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/5-redirect-uris-ca3574c6ee722c7eb407af08a6da632a9e3c74cdab6a6198144a51047decec16.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC Redirects&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next screen should look similar to the following screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/6-oidc-settings-488caba7757e6fec8ac09f80852d308ecdbc9821973625b897bd167427fface1.png&quot; alt=&quot;OIDC Settings&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clientSecret&lt;/code&gt; values for this app will be just below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-spring-boot-oauth-client&quot;&gt;Create a Spring Boot OAuth Client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;helloOAuth.groovy&lt;/code&gt; file that uses Spring Security and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/&quot;&gt;OAuth2 support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-groovy highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Grab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'spring-boot-starter-security'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableOAuth2Sso&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hello World'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@EnableOAuth2Sso&lt;/code&gt; annotation causes Spring Security to look for a number of properties. Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;application.yml&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory and specify the following key/value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;oauth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# From OIDC app&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# clientId&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;clientSecret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# clientSecret&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# From Authorization Server's metadata&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;accessTokenUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# token_endpoint&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;userAuthorizationUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# authorization_endpoint&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;clientAuthenticationScheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# from your Auth Server's metadata, check .well-known/openid-configuration&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# if not in .well-known/oauth-authorization-server&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;userInfoUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# userinfo_endpoint&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;preferTokenInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start your app with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring run helloOAuth.groovy&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be redirected to Okta, but likely see the following error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/7-bad-request-invalid-redirect-bc2e2d9931345a11e86633cfec15a31da11c1879b06c1ee09942ee0d84e4a87c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad Request, Invalid Redirect&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens because Spring Security sends a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;redirect_uri&lt;/code&gt; value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/login&lt;/code&gt;. Navigate to your Okta developer instance and change your OIDC app to have this as a Redirect URI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/8-add-redirect-uri-b58a34bd377fbfc8e1a03ff472949f0b270a4df4ab248829ebce820694c7950f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Redirect URI&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; again, this time you’ll get an error that doesn’t explain as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/9-no-scopes-316896c625170cad5f43ba46a050c941285251cfae2534c192cb113313dc8e3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;No Scopes&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whitelabel error page doesn’t tell you anything, but your browser’s address window does: &lt;em&gt;no scopes were requested&lt;/em&gt;. Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;application.yml&lt;/code&gt; to have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt; property at the same level as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clientAuthenticationScheme&lt;/code&gt;. These are some standard OIDC scopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;clientAuthenticationScheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;openid profile email&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; again and you’ll get an error that &lt;em&gt;User is not assigned to the client app&lt;/em&gt;. Again, you’ll have to look in the address bar to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/10-user-not-assigned-921bede52e10c0cde398bccc561b5113b2084f59d90717093a763c509c5aaa82.png&quot; alt=&quot;User Not Assigned&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your OIDC app in Okta and &lt;strong&gt;Assign People&lt;/strong&gt; to it. Adding your own account is the easiest way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next error you’ll see when trying to authenticate is &lt;em&gt;Policy evaluation failed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/11-policy-evaluation-failure-06a812246eaae06b2b1d2cf85d7adfd258c52b3fd0ab4e79eb01a67672ac88c6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Policy Evaluation Failure&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Okta’s UI, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;gt; API&lt;/strong&gt; and click on your Authorization Server’s name and &lt;strong&gt;Access Policies&lt;/strong&gt;. Click &lt;strong&gt;Add Policy&lt;/strong&gt; to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/12-access-policies-925ff47cd0b74182a070847103c79f692eb882909ad90a13d8619801898ebf4a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Access Policies&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter a name and description and set it to apply to all clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/13-add-policy-c1ab782f1d1f629468dbf7e30af887fbc85300ea71724478e658796cfbfd71e7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Policy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Create Policy&lt;/strong&gt; to continue. Once that completes, click the &lt;strong&gt;Add Rule&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/14-add-rule-454355d16e428ac00c81954f67a7f0a0dc74b9c9ea42c4b687f62c8ea358f58e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Rule&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give the rule a name, accept the default values, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Create Rule&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/15-default-grant-rules-f1fed59c1b99d77b4f7f0781b87a2a3933ee86b7352b9448e23ef438dda7ebcd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Default Grant Rules&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; again and this time it should work. If it does - congrats!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make one additional change to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;helloOAuth.groovy&lt;/code&gt; file to prove it’s really working: change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;home()&lt;/code&gt; method to return &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hello $name&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$name&lt;/code&gt; is from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;javax.security.Principal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-groovy highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@GetMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Principal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hello '&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should result in your app showing a result like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-oauth/16-success-08647e6415a7576d72869bdf3d091d363a8cff9fc11adbfcd09015a953dd9b35.png&quot; alt=&quot;Success&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code for this tutorial and the examples in it are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-oauth-example&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial showed you how to use Spring CLI, Groovy, Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Okta to quickly prototype an OAuth client. This information is useful for those that are developing a Spring MVC application with traditional server-rendered pages. However, these days, lots of developers are using JavaScript frameworks and mobile applications to build their UIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a future tutorial, I’ll show you how to develop one of these fancy UIs in Angular and use the access token retrieved to talk to a Spring Boot API that’s secured by Spring Security and does JWT validation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Get Started with Spring Boot, SAML, and Okta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to show you how build a Spring Boot application that leverages Okta’s Platform API for authentication via SAML. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based standard for securely exchanging authentication and authorization information between entities—specifically between identity providers, service providers, and users. Well-known IdPs include Salesforce, Okta, OneLogin, and Shibboleth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Okta developer experience began a couple years ago (in December 2014) when I worked for a client that was adopting it. I was tasked with helping them decide on a web framework to use, so I built prototypes with Node, Ruby, and Spring. I documented my findings in &lt;a href=&quot;https://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/integrating_node_js_ruby_and&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mraible/status/550057304331001856&quot;&gt;I tweeted&lt;/a&gt; my issues with Spring Boot, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27713524/how-do-i-configure-spring-security-saml-to-work-with-okta?stw=2&quot;&gt;asked how to fix it&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow. I ended up figuring out the solution through trial-and-error and my findings made it into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-security-saml/1.0.x-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/chapter-idp-guide.html#d5e1816&quot;&gt;official Spring documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-security-saml/1.0.x-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/chapter-idp-guide.html#d5e1816&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Things have changed a lot since then and now Spring Security 4.2 has support for auto-loading custom DSLs. And guess what, there’s even a DSL for SAML configuration!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to get started? You can follow along in with the written tutorial below, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-saml-example&quot;&gt;check out the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or watch the screencast I made to walk you through the same process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBtyGfrz-jA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sign-up-for-an-okta-developer-account&quot;&gt;Sign Up for an Okta Developer Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward two years, and I find myself as an Okta employee. To start developing with Okta, I created a new developer account at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com&quot;&gt;https://developer.okta.com&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you take a screenshot or write down your Okta URL after you’ve signed up. You’ll need this URL to get back to the admin console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll receive an email to activate your account and change your temporary password. After completing these steps, you’ll land on your dashboard with some annotations about “apps”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-saml-application-on-okta&quot;&gt;Create a SAML Application on Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, the easiest way to create a SAML-aware Spring Boot application is to use Spring Security’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml-dsl&quot;&gt;SAML DSL project&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a sample project that provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml-dsl/blob/master/samples/spring-security-saml-dsl-sample/README.md&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for configuring Okta as a SAML provider. These instructions will likely work for you if you’re experienced Spring Boot and Okta developer. If you’re new to both, this “start from scratch” tutorial might work better for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like I did, the first thing you’ll need to do is create a developer account at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.okta.com&quot;&gt;https://developer.okta.com&lt;/a&gt;. After activating your account, login to it and click on the “Admin” button in the top right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/okta-userhome-3e85f9a56b2d8d16d25fdd462d0a7cbf82417bd8fe7adaa3a67c1e7dd4b04a78.png&quot; alt=&quot;Okta UserHome&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next screen, click “Add Applications” in the top right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/okta-dashboard-4bb06c150497597bbe9a2ac85ecf14f90508c2dea8c29a22aa4d4f4ddace94ec.png&quot; alt=&quot;Okta Dashboard&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will bring you to a screen with a “Create New App” green button on the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/create-new-app-42c727730965cd56487420d4efc3fae744ccecbac9100ae834e7f48e90c11ec9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create New App&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the button and choose “Web” for the platform and “SAML 2.0” for the sign on method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/new-app-saml-2.0-db813317bc386621bbaa114e0a8c6896c9a5b10a38a4f1fa71e0e256f1a1224b.png&quot; alt=&quot;New App with SAML 2.0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the “Create” button. The next screen will prompt you for an application name. I used “Spring SAML”, but any name will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/app-name-86fa4c7f992c8e1e8dfc872cd368864801fbab0b9447e37ae00b201a933f9210.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter App name&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the “Next” button. This brings you to the second step, configuring SAML. Enter the following values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Single sign on URL: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://localhost:8443/saml/SSO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audience URI: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://localhost:8443/saml/metadata&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/saml-integration-e924706bdfb4c0e0261dc9ea9dc0841fda556b9f12c34fe2704bf34956266a3a.png&quot; alt=&quot;SAML Integration&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scroll to the bottom of the form and click “Next”. This will bring you to the third step, feedback. Choose “I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app” and optionally select the App type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/customer-or-partner-4c0bbd3973b53f9f40d46527301ecc8592531b7fba18c112d9125581fdb12240.png&quot; alt=&quot;Customer or Partner&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the “Finish” button to continue. This will bring you to the application’s “Sign On” tab which has a section with a link to your applications metadata in a yellow box. Copy the &lt;strong&gt;Identity Provider metadata&lt;/strong&gt; link as you’ll need it to configure your Spring Boot application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/saml-metadata-cd2287ef5b0b1e57d55a6f353908ef5e4c4c639f504e23c7275db04fea9e71d4.png&quot; alt=&quot;SAML Metadata&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final setup step you’ll need is to assign people to the application. Click on the “People” tab and the “Assign to People” button. You’ll see a list of people with your account in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/assign-people-dd0a2be0a2727d67fa0637b7a450ecfb26c858e44c78636ec700a536c3773be6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Assign People&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the assign button, accept the default username (your email), and click the “Done” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-spring-boot-application-with-saml-support&quot;&gt;Create a Spring Boot Application with SAML Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.spring.io&quot;&gt;https://start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt; in your favorite browser and select Security, Web, Thymeleaf, and DevTools as dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/start.spring-250ffb33a9cdd45c275b5f7ee0a8d8ee7c0cc2e8a08dd7f1b3cde531e182e8ae.png&quot; alt=&quot;start.spring.io&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click “Generate Project”, download the generated ZIP file and open it in your favorite editor. Add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spring-security-saml-dsl&lt;/code&gt; dependency to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;org.springframework.security.extensions&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;spring-security-saml-dsl&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.0.0.M3&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to add the Spring Milestone repository since a milestone release is all that’s available at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;spring-milestones&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Spring Milestones&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to see instructions for Gradle, please view the project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml-dsl/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt;, add the following key/value pairs. Make sure to use the “Identity Provider metadata” value you copied earlier (hint: you can find it again under the “Sign On” tab in your Okta application).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;server.port = 8443
server.ssl.enabled = true
server.ssl.key-alias = spring
server.ssl.key-store = src/main/resources/saml/keystore.jks
server.ssl.key-store-password = secret

security.saml2.metadata-url = &amp;lt;your metadata url&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a terminal window, navigate to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/resources&lt;/code&gt; directory of your app and create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;saml&lt;/code&gt; directory. Navigate into the directory and run the following command. Use “secret” when prompted for a keystore password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;keytool -genkey -v -keystore keystore.jks -alias spring -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The values for the rest of the questions don’t matter since you’re not generating a real certificate. However, you will need to answer “yes” to the following question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Is &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Unknown, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Unknown, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Unknown, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Unknown, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Unknown, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Unknown correct?
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;no]:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SecurityConfiguration.java&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;com.example&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;springframework&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;extensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;saml2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;SAMLConfigurer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;saml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableGlobalMethodSecurity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableWebSecurity&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;securedEnabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;basePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;identityProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;metadataFilePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;metadataUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IndexController.java&lt;/code&gt; file in the same directory and use it to set the default view to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.stereotype.Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Controller&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;IndexController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;index&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you chose Thymeleaf when creating your application, you can create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/main/resources/templates/index.html&lt;/code&gt; and it will automatically be rendered after you sign-in. Create this file and populate it with the following HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Spring Security SAML Example&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Hello SAML!
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-the-app-and-login-with-okta&quot;&gt;Run the App and Login with Okta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the app using your IDE or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn spring-boot:run&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://localhost:8443&quot;&gt;https://localhost:8443&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re using Chrome, you’ll likely see a privacy error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/connection-not-private-4c4dce4ee0839b72abdd94a7cf97ef3610402ea2062bf44a34f59add1c14177d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Connection Not Private&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the “ADVANCED” link at the bottom. Then click the “proceed to localhost (unsafe)” link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/connection-not-private-proceed-fe5ba0fd6308c96fc912453079815090a8781a7ba7025868fc1d632b1bc70aca.png&quot; alt=&quot;Proceed to localhost&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you’ll be redirected to Okta to sign in and redirected back to your app. If you’re already logged in, you won’t see anything from Okta. If you sign out from Okta, you’ll see a login screen such as the one below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/okta-login-b529f9ea23f41bc85ab4e9a04392eb079a7cca10b94b4cac460134fe3f1cf725.png&quot; alt=&quot;Okta Login&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve logged in, you should see a screen like the one below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/spring-boot-saml/hello-saml-b02f43bbec741e570382cad20cb0d1d4c824b63597efd072074124c474a1f0a9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello SAML&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;source-code&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code for this article at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-saml-example&quot;&gt;https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-saml-example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-more&quot;&gt;Learn More&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article showed you how to create a SAML application in Okta and talk to it using Spring Boot and Spring Security’s SAML extension. The SAML extension hasn’t had a GA release, but hopefully will soon. I also believe it’s possible to take the SAML DSL (in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SecurityConfiguration.java&lt;/code&gt;) and create a Spring Boot starter that allows you to get started with SAML simply by configuring application properties.&lt;/p&gt;

Post your question to Stack Overflow with the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta&quot;&gt;okta&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta-api&quot;&gt;okta-api&lt;/a&gt;” tag, hit me up via email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:matt.raible@okta.com&quot;&gt;matt.raible@okta.com&lt;/a&gt;, or ping me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mraible&quot;&gt;@mraible&lt;/a&gt;. In future articles, I’ll show you to to configure Spring Boot with OAuth 2.0 and Okta. Then I’ll explore different techniques of authenticating with Angular and using the access token to talk to a secured Spring Boot application. Until then, happy authenticating! 😊&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to use KentorIT AuthServices with Okta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering how to configure an ASP.NET application with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KentorIT/authservices&quot;&gt;KentorIT’s AuthServices&lt;/a&gt; and Okta, you’ve come to the right place. But before delving into the specifics of how to make Okta work with an SAML-enabled ASP.NET application powered by KentorIT AuthServices, is is worth spending some time going over a critical, but easily fixable issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note&lt;/strong&gt; : As of March 22nd, 2016, you have 2 choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either get the source code of the AuthServices assemblies and compile them on your own machine. In this case, no specific adjustment is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or use the v0.17 KentorIT NuGet assemblies. In this case, if you plan to use the SampleApplication project (not the SampleMvcApplication) for testing purposes, make sure you remove the following line from the web.config file:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;requestedAuthnContextclassRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;=&quot;Password&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;comparison=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Minimum&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t, the SP-initiated login flow will fail because Okta won’t manage to deserialize the SAMLRequest parameter (due to a case issue).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you should configure an app powered by Kentor AuthServices to make it work with Okta:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download the latest version of KentorIT’s AuthServices from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KentorIT/authservices&quot;&gt;https://github.com/KentorIT/authservices&lt;/a&gt; and open the Kentor.AuthServices.sln solution in Visual Studio.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the SampleApplication project and make a note of its URL property:
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/VSProjectProperties-894b4f35b40452adbda65e396b2f77d6ee54722ddfefb2e8b1b110d21ea14d65.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Project properties&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to you Okta organization and navigate to Admin =&amp;gt; Applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the &lt;strong&gt;Add Application&lt;/strong&gt; button and the green &lt;strong&gt;Create New App&lt;/strong&gt; button
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/CreateNewAppButton-34ce571996f9d3bcb7a56c3b06006e4b3481d687be046c8b67a8210db5c8c381.png&quot; alt=&quot;Press the Create a new Okta app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;SAML 2.0&lt;/strong&gt; option and press the &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; button.
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/SAML2Option-2f7d8fae80847c3d7becd573c9d8150928c810c98c29d8a6dcc654f3464b9d9d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose the SAML 2.0 template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give your application a name and optionally upload a custom logo. We’ll call it “&lt;strong&gt;Kentor AuthServices App 1&lt;/strong&gt;”
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/OktaAppName-cd53f2a7c06794e10f57b1d93eab0c0fe3921677fa40994f9d8eb5dfc4650df2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Give your Okta app a name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Single sign on URL&lt;/strong&gt; field, enter the url you retrieved above in step #2 and append “ &lt;strong&gt;/AuthServices/Acs&lt;/strong&gt;”, for instance &lt;strong&gt;http://localhost:18714/SamplePath/AuthServices/Acs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the Audience URI field, enter the Url you retrieved above in step #2 and append “ &lt;strong&gt;/AuthServices&lt;/strong&gt;”, for instance &lt;strong&gt;http://localhost:18714/SamplePath/AuthServices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Name ID format&lt;/strong&gt; field, select the default &lt;strong&gt;Unspecified&lt;/strong&gt; (or select any other value of your choice).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Show Advanced Settings&lt;/strong&gt; link. For the &lt;strong&gt;Signature Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; field, we suggest that you leave the default value, SHA-256. However, if you do, you will need to add the following line of code to the Application_Start() method of your Global.asax.cs file:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Kentor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;AuthServices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;GlobalEnableSha256XmlSignatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you may switch to RSA-SHA1 though we do not recommend it (as it less secure than SHA-256).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the Attribute Statements section, optionally enter additional attributes, such as in the following screenshot:
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/OptionalAttributeStatements-fba16e17b56be1e56820bfe4eb115f882e4bf2e58475d07c726c0db8ad766582.png&quot; alt=&quot;Optional Attribute Statements&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; button. Select the &lt;strong&gt;I’m a software vendor&lt;/strong&gt; option (if you’re indeed a vendor - if you are developing an internal app, select the first option) and press the Finish button.
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/VendorOrCustomerOption-00764161453e0f5de30afb8f79fb255dfd9ff4fe62aad63ac9670128551fc23a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select the customer or vendor option&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now edit the web.config file of the SampleApplication project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;kentor.authServices&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section, enter the following values:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;entityId&lt;/strong&gt; = same value as the Audience URI for the Okta app, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:18714/SamplePath/AuthServices&quot;&gt;http://localhost:18714/SamplePath/AuthServices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;returnUrl&lt;/strong&gt; = value of the web application’s url, i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:18714/SamplePath&quot;&gt;http://localhost:18714/SamplePath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;identityProviders&gt; section, enter the following values:
&lt;/identityProviders&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;entityId&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Identity Provider Issuer&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Sign On&lt;/strong&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;View Setup Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/ViewSetupInstructions-5b84fcb652fc6dc3480000e73db926367b638e657e9143c5f12361af0ab70be6.png&quot; alt=&quot;View setup instructions&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/IdentityProviderIssuer-6d097c5b8c2e12adf8463887e43200fc1c0fb9d46ed92c84b91b84c5cc090478.png&quot; alt=&quot;Identity Provider Issuer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;signOnUrl&lt;/strong&gt; = value of the &lt;strong&gt;Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL&lt;/strong&gt; below
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KentorOkta/IdPSSOUrl-5c5b57ceefc845fb39eff86a39d234e93ea2865156b3e3ab4ce2c3ba9f32b231.png&quot; alt=&quot;Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;signingCertificate&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section, download the &lt;strong&gt;okta.cert&lt;/strong&gt; X.509 certificate from the instructions page in the Okta app and put it in the &lt;strong&gt;App_Data&lt;/strong&gt; folder of your web application. Then reference it accordingly (such as with &lt;strong&gt;fileName=”~/App_Data/okta.cert&lt;/strong&gt;”) in the web.config file.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be good to go now! Don’t forget to assign users to your Okta application and test that you can sign in into your SAML application both from the Okta portal (IdP-initiated sign-in flow) and from your SAML application itself (SP-initiated sign-in flow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run into any issue while using the SP-initiated login flow (when a user clicks on the “Sign In” link of the /SamplePath page), then try to recompile the KentorIT.AuthServices project and make sure it is used by your project. If your project uses v0.17 of the NuGet corresponding library, make sure to comment out any &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;requestedAuthnContext &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section in your web.config file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Okta’ing!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>REST Service Authorization with JWTs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many companies are adopting micro-services based architectures to promote
decoupling and separation of concerns in their applications. One inherent
challenge with breaking applications up into small services is that now each
service needs to deal with authenticating and authorizing requests made to it.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519&quot;&gt;Json Web Tokens (JWTs)&lt;/a&gt; offer a clean
solution to this problem along with
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/12/02/tls-client-authentication-for-services&quot;&gt;TLS client authentication&lt;/a&gt;
lower down in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wils Dawson and I presented these topics to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/sfjava/&quot;&gt;Java User Group&lt;/a&gt;
at Okta’s HQ in December and are thrilled to offer the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/JonTodd1/rest-service-authetication-with-tls-jwts&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wdawson/dropwizard-auth-example&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, and the following
recording of the presentation. In the talk, we cover authentication and
authorization both at a server level with TLS and a user level with OAuth 2.0.
In addition, we explain claims based auth and federation while walking through
demos for these concepts using Java and Dropwizard. We purposely skipped over
client (e.g. browser) side authentication as it’s enough material for a future
talk and focused on solutions for authentication and authorization between
services within an application.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Demystifying OAuth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that OAuth 2.0 is everywhere these days. Whether you are building a hot new single page web application (SPA), a native mobile experience, or just trying to integrate with the API economy, you can’t go far without running into the popular authorization framework for REST/APIs and social authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/oktane15/&quot;&gt;Oktane15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlmcguinness&quot;&gt;Karl McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;, our Senior Director of Identity, demystified the powerful, yet often misunderstood, world of OAuth 2.0 and shared details on Okta’s growing support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://openid.net/connect/&quot;&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TLS Client Authentication for Internal Services</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, the most aggravating thing is finding a Stack Overflow
question that exactly describes the issue you are facing, only to scroll down
and see that it has remained unanswered since 2011. I was recently trying to
configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Client-authenticated_TLS_handshake&quot;&gt;client
authentication&lt;/a&gt;
(also referred to as mutual SSL) between two internal services at Okta and
found the lack of complete examples astonishing. I hope that this blog post
provides a better understanding of how to accomplish client authentication in
your applications and makes all that hard security stuff a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tls-background&quot;&gt;TLS Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a normal TLS handshake, the server sends its certificate to the client so
that the client can verify the authenticity of the server. It does this by
following the certificate chain that issued the server’s certificate until it
arrives at a certificate that it trusts. If the client reaches the end of the
chain without finding a certificate that it trusts, it will reject the
connection. For an example of what a server might send, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jpf/9282d558bcc105ae8e1a&quot;&gt;this
gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-10-29-tls-client-authentication-for-services-tls-handshake-087ac6491ae2194de533721278abdab3628e8eeab8342e046476917cc34d985f.png&quot; alt=&quot;TLS handshake&quot; width=&quot;540px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Image reprinted with permission from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-the-origin-with-tls-authenticated-origin-pulls/&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mutual SSL, the client also sends its certificate to the server
for the server to authenticate along with an additional message (called the
CertificateVerify message), which assures the server that the client is the true
owner of the certificate. The server follows the same process of checking the
certificate chain until it finds one it trusts, refusing the connection if it
can’t find such a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is that useful? You probably interact with typical TLS all the time in
your browser. For example, when you visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com&quot;&gt;https://www.okta.com&lt;/a&gt;, your browser
is verifying that the server serving Okta’s site is authentic (that it’s not
impersonating a legitimate Okta server). But Okta’s server has no idea who your
browser is. In this case it doesn’t care too much, so it lets you connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we start talking about services talking to each other, authenticating the
client becomes important because it lowers the risk of our servers divulging
information to machines impersonating our services. For example, let’s say we
have a service called the User Service that holds all the information about
users in our application. We have another service called the Home Page Service
that serves up the home page to the browser. The home page has the user’s name,
email, phone number, and other personal information. The Home Page Service needs
to talk to the User Service to get the user’s name to display on the page. In
this case, the Home Page Service is the client and the User Service is the
server. If we only used normal TLS, only the User Service would be
authenticated! We need TLS client authentication to make sure the User Service
doesn’t provide data to a random client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementing-tls-client-authentication&quot;&gt;Implementing TLS Client Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, the client and server are internal services communicating with each
other. I won’t cover configuring a browser client or other clients that may be
not under your control. In this post, I’ll give examples for the technology we
use at Okta. Specifically, we use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropwizard.io/&quot;&gt;Dropwizard&lt;/a&gt; as
the server framework and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jersey.java.net/&quot;&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; for the client
framework. We’ll also use Java’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html&quot;&gt;keytool&lt;/a&gt;
for building the key and trust stores in Java KeyStore (JKS) format. The
examples below use these technologies, but I hope they’ll be fairly transferable
to choices you make in your applications. In addition, these samples are not
meant to be complete, so you may need to modify them to fit in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;certificates-and-key-stores&quot;&gt;Certificates and Key Stores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-10-29-tls-client-authentication-for-services-ca-chain-e98aec0e5f0e95b2c26cbf79d19628f3629df2d48203d1aaaf8fa0536e2780c3.png&quot; alt=&quot;CA heirarchy&quot; width=&quot;540px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s setup our trust store, which is just a key store that will only
contain certificates. Let’s assume we have a layered Certificate Authority (CA)
structure, like the image above, with a root CA and a subordinate global CA. The
root CA has its private key stored offline and its certificate is the one we
want our services to trust. The root certificate is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; certificate we
want our services to trust on that channel. We don’t even want a certificate
issued by a reputable 3rd party CA to be trusted by our service. So our trust
store will contain only the root certificate, which means the server will only
establish connections from clients that have a certificate issued by the root CA
or its child, the global CA, which will be the issuer of our server’s
certificate. This way, it’s quite easy to rotate our server’s certificate,
either when it expires or if it is somehow compromised; we can just change it on
that service and don’t have to worry about the other services it communicates
with losing trust because they trust the root. If all our services trusted each
other explicitly, the rotation would be much more difficult, especially if you
can’t take downtime. We’ll use the trust store for both the client and the
server, so you only need to make one, which you can copy if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Import your root certificate into a new trust store and follow the prompts&lt;/span&gt;
keytool -import -alias root -file root.crt -keystore truststore.jks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve set up trust, we want to issue the certificate for our service
that chains up to the root. We’ll use the global CA to issue our server its
certificate, and since the global CA’s certificate is issued by the root CA,
we have a chain of trust. When we create the server’s certificate, we’ll include
the chain as well for clients to verify. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.2&quot;&gt;TLS
standard&lt;/a&gt; specifies that the
certificate chain does not require the actual root of trust since the endpoints
will have it already, so we’ll omit it to save bandwidth. Once we have the
certificate we’ll put it in a JKS for our Dropwizard application to use. If
your client does not have a certificate for service-to-service communication,
you can follow a similar pattern to create its certificate. But if it does have
an existing certificate, you can just reuse that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Create our server's key&lt;/span&gt;
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Create the csr and follow the prompts for country code, ou, etc&lt;/span&gt;
openssl req -new -key server.key -sha256 -out server.csr

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Sign the csr with your CA&lt;/span&gt;
openssl ca -in server.csr -days 365 -config my-ca-conf.cnf -out server.crt

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Cat the cert chain together (except the root)&lt;/span&gt;
cat server.crt global.crt &amp;gt; chain.crt

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Create pkcs12 file for key and cert chain&lt;/span&gt;
openssl pkcs12 -export -name server-tls -in chain.crt -inkey server.key -out server.p12

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Create JKS for server&lt;/span&gt;
keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore keystore.jks -srckeystore server.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias server-tls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;server-configuration&quot;&gt;Server Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our key and trust stores, let’s configure the server’s
Dropwizard application connector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;applicationConnectors&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8443&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Key store settings
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keyStorePath&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keystore&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jks&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keyStorePassword&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;notsecret&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;certAlias&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tls&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;enableCRLDP&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Trust store settings
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trustStorePath&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;truststore&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jks&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trustStorePassword&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;notsecret&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Fail fast at startup if the certificates are invalid
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;validateCerts&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Whether or not to require authentication by peer certificate.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;needClientAuth&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Check peer certificates for validity when establishing a connection
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;validatePeers&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The list of supported SSL/TLS protocols. You may need to modify
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# this section to support clients that you have.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;supportedProtocols&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;TLSv1.2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;supportedCipherSuites&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384&quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;allowRenegotiation&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was pretty easy, huh? No cryptic OpenSSL commands! Now our server should be
configured to refuse connections from clients not presenting a root issued
certificate chain. We can test to make sure that happens! We can start our
server, telling Java to debug the SSL handshakes, and make sure we see it
refusing the connection for the right reason. In one terminal start the
Dropwizard server debugging SSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;java -Djavax.net.debug&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;SSL,keymanager,trustmanager -jar your/jar.jar server config.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another terminal run the following curl commands and verify you get the
expected results. First, make sure that the server does not talk HTTP over our
port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl localhost:443
curl: &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;52&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; Empty reply from server

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The server should print something like the following because of no TLS:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, check that the server is sending your certificate back over HTTPS.
curl has a preconfigured list of trusted certs and chances are your
root certificate is not in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl https://localhost:443
curl: &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;60&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; SSL certificate problem: Invalid certificate chain

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The server will print a bunch of stuff ending with something like:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received close_notify during handshake&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ensure that the server terminates the connection if no client cert is
provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl -k https://localhost:443
curl: &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;35&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; Server aborted the SSL handshake

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The server will, again, print a bunch of stuff ending with something like:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: null cert chain&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-configuration&quot;&gt;Client Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ll configure our client to talk to the server. I’ll use the Jersey 2.X
API, but there are equivalents in the 1.X as well as in the Apache HTTP library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Assume the following variables are initialized already&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RSAPrivateKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X509Certificate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientCert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X509Certificate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;globalCert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X509Certificate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rootCert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X509Certificate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;certChain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientCert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;globalCert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// setup key store&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;KeyStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientKeyStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;KeyStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;JKS&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientKeyStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toCharArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientKeyStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setKeyEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;service-tls&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toCharArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;certChain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// setup trust store&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;KeyStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clientTrustStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;KeyStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;JKS&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tightening-things-up&quot;&gt;Tightening Things Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are just granting any service with a certificate signed by our root CA to
talk to our server. Chances are we’d like to trim this down to only clients that
should be talking to the server so we can refuse some other service that has
no business with our server even though it has a certificate issued by our root
CA. This is useful for preventing another service we have from accessing our new
service. For example, suppose in addition to a User Service and a Home Page
Service, we have an Event Service. We may want to block the Event Service from
communicating with the User Service while allowing the Home Page Service to do
that communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, we could change our server’s trust store to only contain the
public key of the client, but this presents problems (and more work) when we try
to rotate that key pair. So, instead, let’s try having the server check that the
hostname of the client is one that it expects to hear from. We can also do this
in the other direction (client verifying the server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several options exist for verifying the hostname on the server side. The first
is one that Dropwizard supports this verification with a tricky configuration
change for the underlying Java SSL connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;applicationConnectors&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#...
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;endpointIdentificationAlgorithm&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTPS endpoint identification algorithm will cause Java to do hostname
verification against your cert. Specifically, this will check the hostname of
the client that made the request against the DN that is given in the client’s
certificate. If they do not match, the connection will be refused. This is a
great, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; way to solve
this problem, however it can be tricky to know what the hostnames will be or to
make a wildcard pattern (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280#section-4.2.1.7&quot;&gt;subject alternative name
extension&lt;/a&gt;) for your
clients. We can take a higher-level approach than hostname comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can, instead, provide our server with a regular expression that matches the
DNs that we expect in our certificates. This means we no longer have to worry
about hostnames. So as services move from host to host, they can keep the same
certificate and everything will Just Work™.
Additionally, a certificate can belong to a service rather than an individual
host now so there’s less management that needs to happen. To do this, we just
need to set up a filter in our server and configure a regex to match the DN in
the certificate(s) that are allowed to communicate with our service or else
return a 403 response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.annotation.Priority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.ws.rs.Priorities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.ws.rs.container.PreMatching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.ws.rs.core.Context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.ws.rs.core.Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We defined TLS client authentication and went over how it can help secure your
backend services. We walked through configuring a Dropwizard server with
mandatory TLS client authentication and creating a Jersey client to provide the
appropriate credentials when talking to that server. We also talked about
options to further restrict clients’ ability to talk to the server based on
their certificates. I hope you have a better understanding of how to implement
mutual SSL in your applications. Below are a few things to also keep in mind as
you implement these authentication concepts in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Age of Trust</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viabilify.com/blog/trust&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about how amazing products shape the &lt;strong&gt;trust relationship&lt;/strong&gt; with customers. I think great products are the &lt;em&gt;first step&lt;/em&gt; in building a trust relationship. And like other aspects of the product that are derived from the product but are not physically part of it, the trust relationship is now more important than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you use a product, every engagement with that product has a direct correlation with your perception of the value of that product. — From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viabilify.com/blog/trust&quot;&gt;Product Loyalty Follows Trust Like Form Follows Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, making sure your product solves problems that customers face everyday is not just a &lt;em&gt;good idea&lt;/em&gt;, it’s &lt;strong&gt;table stakes&lt;/strong&gt;. And the bar is rising constantly. The more products improve, the less customers are willing to tolerate bad experiences. With the consumerization of the enterprise, the importance of product design and favorable user experiences is indispensable to every kind of product distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the most important aspects of the product are Product Status/Trust and Customer Support. Having dissected both of these from many angles in my recent work, I know that businesses neglect them at their peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communicate-transparently&quot;&gt;Communicate transparently&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Product Status/Trust page is the first place customers visit on your site when they have a problem. Consider yourself lucky if the customer only had an problem with a browser (like cache), or an issue with their laptop. For more serious issues, customers expect transparency and effective communication from the Product Status/Trust page. They want information that communicates exactly what the problem is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serve-multiple-audiences&quot;&gt;Serve multiple audiences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Product Status/Trust page is also one of the first places that prospects are likely to visit. In fact, when the product is gaining momentum, prospect traffic may exceed customer traffic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve rarely seen a Status/Trust page actually serve both customers and prospects effectively. The key is to find the correct balance. As the product becomes popular, customers and prospects visit the page with very different mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For customers, the Status/Trust page must be the source of truth for issues, downtime, and root cause analysis. This requires radical transparency and effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For prospects, the Status/Trust page must do at least the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Display all the information they need to make an informed decision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make them love the product even more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve as an effective talking point for your sales reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once users get their hands on a product, they often find new ways to use it that the founders never imagined. This experimentation can shape the future of products and platforms. This is especially true of products that also provide APIs. The growth of B2B2C, B2C2B and other hybrid distribution models means that you are putting your product in front of many different types of audiences, including direct customers, partners, resellers, channel partners, and early and late stage prospects. Understanding how all of these audiences report on the service, interpret the SLA, and react to downtime is crucial if you want to create products that users value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-highly-available-but-prepare-for-risk&quot;&gt;Be highly available but prepare for risk &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a truism that one cannot solve for all technical constraints. Choosing the right platform on which to build your Product and Status/Trust pages is very important, but hosting both pages on the same platform risks both being down at the same time if your site crashes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you cannot afford to let your Trust/Status page go down, so &lt;strong&gt;high availability&lt;/strong&gt; is key. But just in case the page ever &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go down, you need a &lt;strong&gt;risk mitigation plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Central to this is making sure that you are contsantly monitoring your Trust/Status page with enterprise-class monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;send-rapid-robust-and-consistent-notifications&quot;&gt;Send rapid, robust, and consistent notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of trust page problems, make sure that you have ways to easily and automatically notify customers and site ops as soon as issues are detected. Employ RSS, Twitter, and other channels to notify customers; invest in monitoring tools to notify site ops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you send notifications manually, take care not to introduce human error when the site is having issues, as these are usually chaotic periods for your ops team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realize that many of your customers will probably check your trust page &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; call support, so it’s important that the trust page and the support team provide the same information. This also argues for ensuring that your support team is a key stakeholder in the development of your trust page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and developing the Trust Page has taught me much in the last few months. I’d be happy to hear from you on this topic, so please feel free to send comments or questions to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:vimarsh.karbhari@okta.com&quot;&gt;vimarsh.karbhari@okta.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trust Page is the work of an amazing team that includes Tim Gu, Shawn Gupta, Nathan Tate, Wendy Liao, and myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Okta Chased Down Severe System CPU Contention in MySQL</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes fixing a problem causes or reveals a new one. And sometimes this sets off a chain reaction of problems and fixes, where each solution exposes a deeper issue. In technology, cascades like these are common, often painful, and occasionally welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our battle against CPU contention last fall is a good example of such a cascade. What began as a buffer pool adjustment triggered a series of issues and fixes that generated plenty of stress, but ultimately strengthened our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying each of the challenges we faced in that period was the huge amount of business our Sales organization had closed in late summer and early Fall of 2014. Growth brought a dramatic increase in the number of new customers running large import jobs and new orgs running agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As problems go, growing pains are good problems to have. But they usually come at a cost: the increased traffic caused significant CPU contention, as shown in the following image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Pre-buffer_adjustment-58e80e794c7705471c28860e29c13043e7e5ab9f77b701db169e8dce43c38bfc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Before tuning the database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those red and yellow spikes in late October, 2014 seized our attention and spurred an aggressive response from Okta’s site operations team. The team took immediate action to prevent this situation from getting worse and potentially causing a issue with our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuning-the-database&quot;&gt;Tuning the database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, we tuned our MySQL database to fully utilize the amount of RAM in our server instances. We had been running with a relatively small buffer pool
compared to the amount of available RAM, which meant that we were sacrificing both performance and money.  Increasing the size of the buffer pool decreased page response times and nearly eliminated disk reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/EliminateDiskReads-0f613b4d1409fc89d2fed4648451ff471b21c2821b8877e6f61b9d6fbdf43094.png&quot; alt=&quot;Almost eliminated disk reads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doubling-hardware-resources&quot;&gt;Doubling hardware resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the buffer pool adjustment, we continued to see significant CPU contention. In response, we doubled the size of our servers (244 GB of RAM, 32 CPU cores, and 2 x 320 GB HDDs). CPU contention decreased (see the trough in the following image), but probably because of the Thanksgiving holiday, not the additional hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the holiday, CPU spikes returned, now worse than ever. Page render time slowed down, queries against the database took longer, and jobs backed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Thanksgiving-e40444ba87a0d54dd1650c36ff1a5a6aaee6167151397260ff01bc531dc380f3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thanksgiving holiday&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Flat areas in the graph showing no CPU usage indicate periods when we were running on a secondary server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did CPU contention increase after we’d doubled the CPUs? Shouldn’t it have decreased?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kernel-mutex-bottleneck&quot;&gt;Kernel mutex bottleneck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming amount of yellow in our graphs showed extremely high &lt;strong&gt;system CPU usage&lt;/strong&gt; (and &lt;strong&gt;user CPU usage&lt;/strong&gt; was also too high). Clearly, the operating system was working very hard at &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. The metrics we pulled revealed that all the InnoDB threads were busy waiting on the kernel mutex. We had known that kernel mutex was a bottleneck even before we’d doubled hardware resources, but we hadn’t understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer look at the MySQL source code showed that kernel mutex was trying to allocate memory to all of our transactions. This is perfectly normal behavior, but it proved to be very limiting in our case because we perform approximately 85,000 transactions per minute. The kernel has to create a transaction ID for each transaction and allocate a tiny block of memory in RAM before giving it to the thread handling the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we knew why doubling the number of CPUs caused greater contention: instead of  providing transaction IDs and associated memory to approximately 24 InnoDB threads, kernel mutex was now working like mad to provide IDs and memory to approximately 48 InnoDB threads. Imagine having a single toll booth on a 16 lane highway and then &lt;em&gt;doubling the number of lanes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the discussions that followed, some called for rolling back to the smaller machines, reasoning that fewer threads would mean less CPU contention. Others believed that rolling backward would be a mistake, arguing that our business growth required the more powerful servers in any case, and that doubling the number of CPUs was not itself a problem, but rather part of the ultimate solution because it exposed the root cause of the extreme system CPU usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right course – the one we ultimately took – was to stick with the more powerful servers and tune them properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adopting-tcmalloc&quot;&gt;Adopting TCMalloc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly found several resources online, including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html&quot;&gt;key blog post&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;strong&gt;TCMalloc&lt;/strong&gt; (Thread-Caching Memory Allocation) and an article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.olivierdoucet.info/blog/2012/05/19/debugging-a-mysql-stall/&quot;&gt;debugging MySQL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional memory allocation schemes, like the &lt;strong&gt;glibc&lt;/strong&gt; malloc that we were then using, employ a mutex to prevent concurrent access to the transaction ID counter.  Preventing concurrency is totally wrong for a multi-core, multi-thread architecture like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, TCMalloc allocates a small pool of memory to each CPU core. Individual processor threads obtain RAM directly from their core, ideally from the L2 cache nearest the thread’s section of the CPU. This sounded promising, so we switched to TCMalloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the switch, things looked pretty good. User CPU decreased dramatically, never to return to the +50% usage we’d seen before.  We had finally solved the memory allocation bottleneck. If we hadn’t doubled the number of CPUs, we wouldn’t have found the problem that lead us to adopt TCMalloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Had we finally solved our scalability problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transparent-huge-pages-thanks-for-your-helpplease-dont-help&quot;&gt;Transparent Huge Pages: Thanks for your help…please don’t help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the next morning &lt;strong&gt;CPU contention was worse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarmingly high system CPU usage that we’d seen in the previous 3 months was always due to MySQL using kernel mutex. But since we’d fixed that problem, &lt;em&gt;what the heck was this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed turning off TCMalloc, but that would’ve been a mistake. Implementing TCMalloc was a critical link in the chain of problems and solutions that ultimately strengthened our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered very quickly that the culprit this time was a &lt;em&gt;khugepaged&lt;/em&gt; enabled by a Linux kernel flag called &lt;strong&gt;Transparent Huge Pages&lt;/strong&gt; (THP; turned on by default in most Linux distributions). Huge pages are designed to improve performance by helping the operating system manage large amounts of memory. They effectively increase the page size from the standard 4kb to 2MB or 1Gb (depending on how it is configured).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THP&lt;/strong&gt; makes huge pages easier to use by, among other things, arranging your memory into larger chunks.  It works great for app servers that are not performing memory-intensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why THP is so wrong for our platform. By late 2014 we were using 95% of the RAM and 58% of the 32 CPU cores in our servers . In order to store all of those tiny transaction IDs, we were rewriting memory so rapidly that THP’s efforts to move pages around couldn’t keep up. Clearly, standard 4kb blocks were much more efficient for us than the larger page size that THP was “helping” us with. So we turned THP off. The following image tells the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/TCMalloc-2b21a26c5e5ba8ff9afb958d4d1d38b43c2671b93bf3d31c59f796f54dfa87a0.png&quot; alt=&quot;TCMalloc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Flat areas in the graph showing no CPU usage indicate periods when we were running on a secondary server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, encountering the dramatic effect of THP, an operating system problem, was clarifying. It validated our previous remedies, and turning it off definitely strengthened our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical lessons we learned during this period, we were reminded that sometimes the best thing to do is stay the course. At times we were tempted to pull back, but moving forward ultimately paid off as each improvement we made exposed the inadequacy (for our platform) of a downstream component.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Okta Software Engineering Design Principles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Okta has been an agile development shop since the beginning. One important
aspect of being agile is enabling a mix of bottom-up and top-down decision
making. Specifically where high level vision and strategy is clearly
communicated enabling teams to autonomously deliver value while also feeding back
learnings from the trenches to inform the high level
goals.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:the-knowledge-creating-company&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:the-knowledge-creating-company&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Below are the tacit engineering design
principles we’ve used to guide development at Okta. They continue to evolve
as we experiment and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-create-user-value&quot;&gt;1. Create User Value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, writing software is about creating value for users. This
seems straight forward, but as systems evolve and become more complex we
start introducing more abstraction and layering which brings us further away
from the concrete problem we’re trying to solve. It’s important to keep in mind
the reason for writing software in the first place and use the understanding
of the audience to inform priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Okta, our entire company is aligned on this principle because our #1 core
value is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/customers/focus-on-customer-success.html&quot;&gt;customer
success&lt;/a&gt;.  In
practice this means there’s almost always a number of customers eager to beta a
new feature we’re working on. We collaborate closely with customers while
building features allowing for continuous feedback as we iterate and get
changes out in weekly sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png&quot; alt=&quot;xkcd - pass the salt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-keep-it-simple&quot;&gt;2. Keep it Simple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler — Albert
  Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This truism has been around for ages, and it goes hand-in-hand with the
first principle.  If it doesn’t add value to users now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it&quot;&gt;you ain’t gonna
need it - YAGNI&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all encounter overly complex code where it’s nearly impossible to reason
about what it does. Part of this confusion is because it’s
generally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&quot;&gt;harder to read code than to write
it&lt;/a&gt; but beyond 
that, there are clearly fundamental qualities of some code making it
more intuitive than other code. There’s a lot of prior art on this topic and a
great place to start is &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=dwSfGQAACAAJ&quot;&gt;Clean
Code&lt;/a&gt; by Robert C. Martin, aka
Uncle Bob. The book breaks down the qualities of code which make it
intuitive, and provides a framework for reasoning about code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some guiding principles about writing clean code we use in practice
which are also covered in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes intent clear, use comments when code isn’t expressive enough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be read and enhanced by others (or the author after a few
years)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provides one way, rather than many, to do a particular task&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is idomatic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is broken into pieces which each does one thing and does it well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day there is no substitue for experience, like any craft,
writing clean code takes practice. At Okta every engineer is constantly honing
their skills, we rely heavily on code reviews and pair programming to help hone
each other’s skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-05-08-software-engineering-design-principles-code_quality_wtfs_per_minute-068f133fb5ae6e478037afaa831e8856a28700e08665a9beae3f5ec9d83aa67a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wtfs per minute&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-know-thy-service-with-data&quot;&gt;3. Know Thy-Service With Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of “big data” this point needs little explanation. Okta collects
massive amounts of operational data about our systems to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor health&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debug issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audit security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every new feature we add, developers are responsible for ensuring that
their designs provide visibility into these dimensions. In order to make this an
efficient process we’ve invested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runtime logging control toggling by level, class, tenant, user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creation of dashboards and alerts is self-service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every developer has access to metrics and anonymous unstructured data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Request ID generated at edge is passed along at every layer of stack for
correlation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineering control panel for common operational tasks like taking threaddumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies we use to gain visibility include: PagerDuty, RedShift,
Zabbix, ThousandEyes, Boundary, Pingdom, App Dynamics, Splunk, ELK, S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-make-failure-cheap&quot;&gt;4. Make Failure Cheap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every software system will experience failures and all code has bugs. While we
constantly work at having fewer, it’s unrealistic to assume they won’t occur. So,
in addition to investing in prevention, we invest in making failure cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of failure becomes significantly more expensive 
further out on the development timeline. Making adjustments 
during requirements gather and design are significantly cheaper than 
finding issues in production.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:agile-cost-curve&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:agile-cost-curve&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-05-08-software-engineering-design-principles-agile-cost-curve-129b2db3badfee2f2abf19948abe3b40c4f2ce03b5c8ee52e51ce85c188991c0.png&quot; alt=&quot;cost curve of development&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fundamental we take from both Agile and XP is to invest in pushing failure
as early in the development timeline as possible. We mitigate failures from
poor requirements gathering by iterating quickly with the customer as described in
Principle 1. Once we get to design and development we make failure cheap through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design reviews with stakeholders ahead of writing code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TDD - developers write all tests for their code; test isn’t a separate phase
from development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping master stable - check-in to master is gated by passing all unit,
functional and UI tests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers can trigger CI on any topic branch; CI is massively parallelized
over a cloud of fast machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our testing phase is done during development the next phase is production
deployments. At this phase we reduce the cost of failure by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hiding beta features behind flags in the code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incremental rollout first to test accounts and then in batches of customers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automated deployment process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code and infrastructure is forwards and backwards compatible allowing
rollback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health check and automatically remove down nodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return a degraded / read-only response over nothing at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An escalator can never break; it can only become stairs – Mitch Hedberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-automate-everything&quot;&gt;5. Automate Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tasks performed routinely should
be automated. These are automation principles we follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automate every aspect of the deployment including long running db migrations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All artifacts are immutable and versioned&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All code modules get dependencies automatically from central artifact server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creation of base images and provisioning of new hardware is automated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All forms of testing are automated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Development environment setup is automated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools we use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AWS - Automated provisioning of hardware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chef - Configuration managment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ansible - Automated deployment orchestration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jenkins - Continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gearman - To get Jenkins to scale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docker - Containerizing services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-with-performance-less-is-more&quot;&gt;6. With Performance, Less is More&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find especially with performance, there are typically huge wins to be had in
up front design decisions which may come at very little to no cost. Our design
mantras for performance are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t do it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it, but don’t do it again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it less&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it later&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it when they’re not looking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it concurrently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it cheaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice we implement a number of strategies to limit risk to poorly
performing code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Major new features and performance tunings live behind feature flags allowing
slow rollout and tuning in real life environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chunk everything that scales on order of N. When N is controlled by customer
enforce limits and design for infinity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slow query and frequent query monitoring to detect poor access patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-05-08-software-engineering-design-principles-more_is_less-596e959adab902d2f9c1c944f622c98d78f7c7a73b66ed35859028b0c0c78d9e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;if less is more, does that mean more is less?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Productionalizing ActiveMQ</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post describes our odyssey with ActiveMQ, an open-source version of the Java Messaging Service (JMS) API. We use ActiveMQ as the message broker among our app servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a word of thanks. To overcome the challenges we faced with ActiveMQ, we are greatly indebted to a very thorough description of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8054446&quot;&gt;OpenJDK bug&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some other &lt;a href=&quot;https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/standard/classlib/trunk/modules/concurrent/src/main/java/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentLinkedQueue.java&quot;&gt;online resources&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re having problems with ActiveMQ, read on. Maybe our story can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;growing-pains&quot;&gt;Growing Pains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our problems with ActiveMQ date all the way back to 2012. They centered around high memory and CPU usage, message timeout errors, and message queue delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pick up the action in the spring 2014. At that time we were battling a new wave of timeout storms and message queue delays caused by our mixed ActiveMQ configuration (broker &lt;strong&gt;5.4.1&lt;/strong&gt;, client &lt;strong&gt;5.7&lt;/strong&gt;) and increasing traffic on our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we welcomed the growth in traffic as a byproduct of our growing business. And although we did plan to address our mixed ActiveMQ configuration, we decided to delay doing so at that time, opting instead to tune the configuration. So we increased the maximum session size from 500 to 2000, and the page size from 200 to 2000 messages. Increasing the page size served to minimize “hung queue” scenarios — a side effect of using &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19798-01/821-1841/bncer/index.html&quot;&gt;message selectors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;another-inflection-point&quot;&gt;Another Inflection Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and site traffic continued to grow, contributing to another inflection point in the fall of 2014. Timeout storms, CPU spikes, and memory issues returned. It was clear that we could no longer put off upgrading to a newer version of ActiveMQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to skip versions 5.7 and 5.8 in favor of 5.10, mainly because 5.7 was considered unstable, and 5.10 provided improved failover performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would this upgrade finally deliver the stability that had eluded us for so long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-upgrades-bite-back&quot;&gt;When Upgrades Bite Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no. Within 24 hours, memory usage soared, CPUs spiked, and instability returned. Note the dramatic CPU spikes in the following screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-05-08-productionalizing-active-mq-cpu-graph-1-7c11d89865504072d2ce989f2bf07873e874222e93c64c98b2e8b7b9cd1e153c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Active MQ CPU&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent these issues from impacting customers, we were forced to restart brokers, which is always an option of
last resort. Restarting brokers is a delicate operation, which can entail a less-than-smooth failover,
risking message loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We immediately increased memory, but within a day or two we ran out of memory again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;searching-for-the-root-cause&quot;&gt;Searching for the Root Cause&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online search turned up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8054446&quot;&gt;OpenJDK bug&lt;/a&gt; that identified an out of memory issue in the
&lt;em&gt;ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;/em&gt;, which is a class in the &lt;strong&gt;java.util.concurrent&lt;/strong&gt; package included in &lt;strong&gt;JVM version 1.6&lt;/strong&gt;.
When working properly, &lt;em&gt;ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;/em&gt; allows elements to be added and removed from the queue in a
thread-safe manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bug caused a null object to be created whenever an element at the end of the queue was added and
then deleted. This behavior is particularly unfavorable to the way we use queuing. We call ActiveMQ
to create and destroy objects in the queue very quickly, tens of millions of times a day, as users
and agents connect to Okta. As a result, null objects rapidly fill up the queue, memory usage soars,
and CPUs spike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conference-call&quot;&gt;Conference Call&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the site at risk of impacting customer authentication, several key engineers, including Hector
Aguilar, Okta’s CTO and SVP of Engineering, met on a Saturday afternoon conference call. Discussion was intense, and our options were few and unappealing:
(a) revert all the way back to broker version 5.4.1, or (b) upgrade to broker version 5.11, which
was still unreleased and might introduce new problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As team members recall, Hector said very little during the first half of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bug in the JVM surprised Hector, as critical JVM bugs are relatively rare. Fortunately, the
OpenJDK bug we’d found included a very thorough description of the problem, as well as sample code
to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially motivated by curiosity, Hector analyzed the code and the bug description. He saw where the
problem was, and then checked online to see if it had been fixed in newer JDK versions. He noticed that
several things were changing in the class, and that others had attempted to resolve the bug in
different ways, but none that would solve our particular problem. Hector developed a very simple fix
of his own, trying to remain consistent with the work of others. He then verified his fix using the
provided sample code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JVM has a mechanism called &lt;em&gt;endorsed libraries&lt;/em&gt; that allows developers to override an existing
class with a new class, effectively patching the JVM. Hector used this mechanism, packaged his fix
into a jar file, tried it against ActiveMQ, and found that it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mood and direction of the meeting shifted dramatically when Hector said, &lt;em&gt;“Guys, I have a wild
idea. What if we patch the JVM?”&lt;/em&gt; As none of us had ever patched a JVM before, this seemed like a novel approach, even a long
shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fix&quot;&gt;The Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hector sent his JVM patch and sample code to the team and walked us through it. First, he explained
why the other attempted fixes wouldn’t solve our particular problem. He then demonstrated how his override effectively patched the original (faulty) removal method. Members of the
team volunteered to test the override at scale with our simulated environments. Within a few hours,
we were fairly sure that Hector’s fix would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploying-the-patch&quot;&gt;Deploying the Patch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deployed the patch and restarted brokers. It was a success! ActiveMQ no longer ran out of memory
and the CPU spikes ceased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2015-05-08-productionalizing-active-mq-cpu-graph-2-4f5f78ddd3d0b732ad7e8a482233e4dd12beff9fac70a7b4a7657e37d3af198f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Active MQ CPU&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some minor memory leaks remained, but these were eliminated by upgrading to &lt;strong&gt;java-1.7.0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stable-and-looking-at-other-solutions&quot;&gt;Stable, and looking at other solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patching the &lt;em&gt;ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;/em&gt; with ActiveMQ v5.10 and upgrading to java-1.7.0 provided
acceptable stability and faster failover performance. While this is a significant improvement over
where we were last fall, our goal is &lt;strong&gt;zero failover time&lt;/strong&gt;, which ActiveMQ cannot deliver. So, we’re exploring other messaging solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In telling our story, we couldn’t resist tooting our own horn a bit. How many CTOs actually get
their hands dirty tackling product issues? Our CTO doesn’t code very often, but when
he does, he patches the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Android Unit Testing Part IV&amp;#58; Mocking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the third of a four part series on Android Unit Testing. In
the last two articles I discussed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/blog/2015/01/android-unit-testing-part-i-what-makes-strong-test-automation/&quot;&gt;general principles of having
good
tests&lt;/a&gt;
and the way to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/07/android-unit-testing-part-2&quot;&gt;run Android tests on JVM making them
fast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/14/android-unit-testing-part-3&quot;&gt;how to make
your code less coupled&lt;/a&gt;.
This article will explain how to make tests isolated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to mock a dependency, inject it, and then modify our test to
indicate that we are not testing an end-to-end scenario anymore, but
are now testing just one class at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify application Gradle file&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the following code under the dependency section:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;androidTestCompile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'org.easymock:easymock:3.1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FooTest&lt;/code&gt; with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;myapplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;junit.framework.Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.easymock.EasyMockSupport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.Before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.runner.RunWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.robolectric.RobolectricTestRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;easymock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;EasyMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RunWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RobolectricTestRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FooTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EasyMockSupport&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Mocks&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;barMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Before&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create mocks&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;barMock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inject mock&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InjectHelper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;injectMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;barMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testGetFoo_returns4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Arrange&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;barMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;andReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;replayAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Act&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;actualResult&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Assert&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;verifyAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;actualResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InjectHelper&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;androidTest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(I believe the original code for injecting fields is from &lt;strong&gt;Spring&lt;/strong&gt;; however, it was modified afterwards.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;myapplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.lang.reflect.Field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.inject.Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;InjectHelper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;unchecked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;injectMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getDeclaredFields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Iterate through all members&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Skip all non injectable members&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getAnnotation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Make private/prptected members accessible&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setAccessible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get a class of the member&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;injectedClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Check that mock is essentially the same class&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;injectedClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isAssignableFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mockClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inject mock&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IllegalAccessException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// return accessibility&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setAccessible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getSuperclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Woo-Hoo! We are finally done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, your tests are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; — they are executed on a JVM and don’t require going to the network or a persistent layer.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repeatable&lt;/strong&gt; — they don’t depend on emulator stability or network quality.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(potentially!) &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt; — there is a lot of good information out there on how to write good unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;independent&lt;/strong&gt; — since the persistent layer isn’t used, one test won’t influence another.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition to all of this awesomeness, your code should actually be
better off, too. Hopefully writing unit tests will force you to
simplify classes with too many dependencies and more carefully think
through interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let me mention several people who helped me to put this article
together: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/william-dawson/43/140/837&quot;&gt;Wils Dawson&lt;/a&gt; made the initial move to use Robolectric,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadeemlinkedin&quot;&gt;Nadeem Khan&lt;/a&gt; figured out all those pesky details about usage of
Robolectric, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hans-reichenbach/20/94b/5b8&quot;&gt;Hans Reichenbach&lt;/a&gt; put a lot of these integration
steps in writing on our wiki. Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Android Unit Testing Part III&amp;#58; Disintegration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the third of a four part series on Android Unit Testing. In
the last two articles I discussed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/blog/2015/01/android-unit-testing-part-i-what-makes-strong-test-automation/&quot;&gt;general principles of having
good
tests&lt;/a&gt;
and the way to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/07/android-unit-testing-part-2&quot;&gt;run Android tests on JVM making them
fast&lt;/a&gt;. This
part will show how to make your Android code less heavily
coupled. This is a preparation step to ensure that your tests are
isolated from each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to test each unit of work separately to make sure that each
piece of our machinery is working properly. We need to be able to
inject all dependencies into classes under the test (instead of this
class instantiating a production dependency). I am not a fan of
manual dependency injection (i.e., passing them through a
constructor or setters). Such a manual method requires a lot of code
and drags all dependencies through multiple classes to inject them
into the end class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of dependency injection frameworks for Android out
there: Dagger, RoboGuice, SpringAndroid, Guice, and Transfuse are a
few. I won’t go into a detailed comparison, but I like Dagger the
most because it provides compile time injection, and doesn’t
influence runtime (specifically startup time) too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, here there are detailed tutorials at the end of this post and
my summary is below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-summary&quot;&gt;My Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the application Gradle file&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the following code under the dependency section:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'com.squareup.dagger:dagger:1.2.1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;provided&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'com.squareup.dagger:dagger-compiler:1.2.1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the manifest&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the following code to the Application tags:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;android&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.MyApplication&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create the classes&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MyApplication&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MyApplication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectGraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;applicationGraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;onCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;applicationGraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectGraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getModules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getModules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;asList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MyModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;applicationGraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MyModule&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;myapplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;dagger.Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;dagger.Provides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;injects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MyModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MyApplication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MyModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MyApplication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt; and replace code &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;private Foo
foo = new Foo();&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Inject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;and add following code to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// This will inject all @Inject members
// recursively for everything what is marked as @Inject
((MyApplication)getApplicationContext()).inject(this);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; class and replace code &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bar bar = new Bar();&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Inject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Modify Bar class and add&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Inject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, instances of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; are
automatically injected in the runtime. However, your test will fail
with NPE, because the Foo class has a Bar dependency which wasn’t
delivered. I.e., we don’t want it injected by Dagger -— we want mocked
dependency, not a real one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antonioleiva.com/dagger-android-part-2/&quot;&gt;Dependency injection on Android: Dagger (Part 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for the final part of our series, where I will show you
how to make tests isolated. You can also check out the full code at

        <title>Android Unit Testing Part II&amp;#58; Escaping Dalvik’s Hold</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second of a four part series on Android Unit Testing. In
these posts, we’ll walk through the key steps engineers should take
to make Android test fast by running them on JVM (versus running
them on emulator).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For background information on the importance of Android testing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okta.com/blog/2015/01/android-unit-testing-part-i-what-makes-strong-test-automation/&quot;&gt;visit Part I of the series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the need to run tests on an Android device or an
emulator has concerned Android engineers for almost as long as Android
has existed – and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/christian-williams/8/4/30b&quot;&gt;Christian Williams&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;a href=&quot;http://robolectric.org/&quot;&gt;Robolectric&lt;/a&gt; to solve
this problem. Robolectric allows you to run unmodified test code
(referring to Android specific classes) on your desktop (in a JVM)
instead of running them on an emulator or device in the Android
Virtual Machine, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_%28software%29&quot;&gt;Dalvik&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have listed several good tutorials at the end of this post that
illustrate exactly how this can be done, but they also include some
details you may not yet need. So, use the tutorial links for details,
but check out “My Summary” for a short overview of what you need to
do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-summary&quot;&gt;My Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new project in Android Studio (I used Studio 0.8.14)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Choose as example Blank Activity project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the TOP Gradle file&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the following code to the dependencies section:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classpath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'org.robolectric:robolectric-gradle-plugin:0.12.+'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the application Gradle file&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the following code under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply plugin: ‘com.android.application'&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'robolectric'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the following under the dependencies section:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;androidTestCompile&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'junit:junit:4.11'&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;androidTestCompile&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'org.robolectric:robolectric:2.3'&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add this section:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;robolectric&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'**/*Test.class'&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create the code that you want to test&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActivity&lt;/code&gt;. Add the following code to it:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;myapplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;myapplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a test&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Delete the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ApplicationTest&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Create the following &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FooTest&lt;/code&gt; class under your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;androidTest&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;myapplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;junit.framework.Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.Before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.runner.RunWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.robolectric.RobolectricTestRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@RunWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RobolectricTestRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FooTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Before&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testGetFoo_returns4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Arrange&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Act&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;actualResult&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Assert&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;actualResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create the configuration&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;gradle&lt;/strong&gt; configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Set “&lt;strong&gt;Tests&lt;/strong&gt;” as a name.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Choose the top gradle file as a project.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, without launching the emulator, you can run this configuration
and see that your test has passed. It is much faster than before—and
repeatable. You can put this under build automation and it will
totally work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JVM&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are alternative ways to run the test on a JVM. For example,
you can create a &lt;strong&gt;JUnit&lt;/strong&gt; task and ensure that all your tests and
classes don’t touch any Android specific classes. However, this is
not easy, as you must design all your code with this restriction in
mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The changes which we did to run on JVM are great, but we are still
facing the limitations of using integration tests. For example, if
the implementation of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; class changes and now uses the network,
you might start seeing flakiness in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testGetFoo_returns4&lt;/code&gt; test
because of a bad network connection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

to achieve test isolation using dependency injection. You can also
