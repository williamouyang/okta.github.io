Native factors includeSMS, and the Okta Verify soft token for iOS and Android. Integrationsinclude Google Authenticator, RSA SecurID, Symantec VIP, and DuoSecurity.Let’s get started!PrerequisitesTo follow along with this guide, you will need to have your own Okta Developer Edition org and have Postman configured to make API requests to that account.  Creating your Okta Developer Edition orgIf you don’t already have one, create your own Okta DeveloperEdition org by visiting: https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/and following the instructions.  Setting up the Postman API clientAfter you have logged in to your account in your Okta DeveloperEdition org, follow theinstructions on the Okta Developer Documentation page for setting up Postman.Overview of API calls used for multi-factor authenticationBelow is an introduction to using Okta’s Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)API to add MFA to an existing application.In this guide, you will learn the actual HTTPS requests that areinvolved in adding MFA to yourapplication. How use actually make these calls will depend on theprogramming language and web framework that your application uses.If you are writing code in .NET or Java, Okta has helper librariesthat will make it easy to add support for Okta to your applicationin an idiomatic way.Okta’s helper libraries can be found here: http://developer.okta.com/docs/sdk/core/api.htmlSetting up your Okta org for MFABefore you can start writing code, you’ll need to make do a fewthings in the Admin interface to your Okta org.  Enable support for MFA.  Create an API token.Enabling MFA in your Okta orgYou must enable MFA from the Admininterface of your Okta org before you can use it from theOkta API. Here is how to enable MFA foryour Okta org:  Log in to your Okta org as a user with administration.  Click the “Admin” button to get into the Admin interface.  Open the “Security” menu.  Select “Authentication” from the menu.  Click on “Multifactor”.  Click the “Edit” button in the “Factor Types” section.  Check the check boxes next to “Google Authenticator” and “SMSAuthentication”.  Click the green “Save” button.Creating an API token for your Okta orgRequests made to the Okta API are authenticated via an APItoken. Here is how to create an API token for your Oktaorg:  Log in to your Okta org as a user with administration.  Click the “Admin” button to get into the Admin interface.  Open the “Security” menu.  Select “API” from the menu.  Click the “Create Token” button.  Enter “Postman” (or something more descriptive) into the text field.  Click the green “Create Token” button.  Configure Postman to use the Token you just created.Set up PostmanIf you haven’t set up Postman already, you will need to do thatnow. Here are instructions for setting up Postman to work with Okta.Test PostmanBefore you get started, you will want to make sure your Postmansetup is configured correctly, a “Hello World” of sorts. Test yourPostman setup as follows:  Open Postman.  Open the “Collections” section in Postman.  Select the “Users (Okta API)” collection.  Scroll until you see the “GET List Users” request template.  Select the “GET List Users” request template.  Click the blue “Send” button.You’ll know it is working if you get back JSON containing one or more user objects.Create a test userThe first step in adding MFA to an existingapplication is to create a user account in Okta. Among otherthings, creating a user account in Okta allows you to addMFA to your application without needing toupdate your user schemas.For the purposes of this demonstration, we will be creating arandom user generated using the Random User Generator website:  Generate a random user by loading https://randomuser.me inyour browser.  Copy the random user’s data from the website to somewhere youcan refer to later:          First Name      Last Name      Email Address        Open the “Users (Okta API)” collection in Postman.  Create a user using the “POST Create User without Credentials”request template in Postman.  Save the value of the “id” (the User ID) that is returned by Postman, you willbe using this ID a lot. (In Okta, User ID’s start with “00u”)Adding MFANow that you have created a user account in Okta, you are ready tosetup MFA for that user account. A key part of enabling MFA for auser is actually verifying that they have a MFA token. In Okta,this process is known as “Enrollment”. Once a MFA token has beenenrolled, we can then “Verify” that they actually have this tokenby asking them to answer a challenge using their token.The process attaching a factor to a user is similar for every typeof factor that Okta supports. In the video we show how to attach aGoogle Authenticator factor as well as a phone as a factor usingSMS. In this document we will only cover how to attach a GoogleAuthenticator factor.At a high level, the process of attaching a factor to an account issimilar for all factors an works as follows:  Add a factor to the user account.  Enroll the factor.Once the factor has been enrolled, you can verify it as needed.Adding a factor to a user accountUsing the User ID that you created earlier, add a GoogleAuthenticator factor to that user as follows:  Open the “Factors (Okta API)” collection in Postman.  Add a new Google Authenticator Factor to your user with the“POST Enroll Google Authenticator Factor” request template inPostman. Important, be sure to replace the “”template in the request URL with the User ID for the user youcreated previously.  Save the value of the “id” (the Factor ID) that is returned byPostman, you will be using this id in the next step.  Copy the URL located in the “href” value of the “qrcode” linkfound in the “_embedded” object located at the bottom of theresponse in Postman. Open this URL in a new tab of yourfavorite browser.Enroll the factorAfter adding a factor to an Okta user, the next step is to havethe user setup their factor and then prove that they have donethat by answering a challenge with their token.Continuing on from the steps above:  Open Google Authenticator on your phone.  Tap the “+” button in Google Authenticator.  Select the “Scan barcode” option.  Scan the QR Code on the browser tab you opened previously.  Switch to Postman on your computer.  From the “Factors (Okta API)” collection, select the “POSTActivate TOTP Factor” request template.  Replace the “” and “” templates with theUser ID and Factor ID values that you’ve copied previously.  In the JSON body, replace the “passCode” value with thepasscode shown on Google Authenticator.  Click the blue “Send” button.Verifying the factorNow that you’ve verified the factor, you are ready to startverifying MFA tokens! Here is how to do that using Postman:  Open the “Factors (Okta API)” collection in Postman.  Select the “POST Verify TOTP Factor” request template.  Replace the “” and “” templates with theUser ID and Factor ID values that you’ve copied previously.  In the JSON body, replace the “passCode” value with thepasscode shown on Google Authenticator.  Click the blue “Send” button.  A successful verification of a token will result in an HTTPstatus code of 200, with a JSON payload containing the key“factorResult” with the value of “SUCCESS”.(Unsuccessful verification attempts will result in an HTTPstatus code of 403, with a JSON payload containing the key “errorCode”).Learn moreAt this point, you should understand how to use the Okta API to addMFA to an existing application. You can learn more about using theOkta MFA API with the following resources.  The video in this guide.These instructions only cover part of what is covered in the video.  The design principles for the Okta API.  The API documentation for the Okta Factors API.  The API documentation for the Okta Authentication API."

You will need to replace URL and body parameters with ids of specific resources for your specific organization.  This can usually be accomplished by first listing a resource collection with a search or filter, than copying the id of a specific resource.  See API documentation for the specific request for details.The following request example requires a specific user idYou can copy an id from a previous response such as a GET request to list resources and paste it. You can also set environment variables directly from the right-click context menu.  This is recommended so you can re-use the id across multiple requestsAlways check the request preview to ensure all {{id}} variables have been properly replaced before sending the request"

Okta anchors an user with his or her externalId during an import or provisioning synchronization event.  Okta uses the native app-specific identifier or primary key for the user as the externalId.  The externalId is selected during import when the user is confirmed (reconciled) or during provisioning when the user has been successfully created in the target application.  SSO Application Assignments (e.g. SAML or SWA) do not have an externalId as they are not synchronized with the application.Application User StatusSingle Sign-OnUsers assigned to an application for SSO without provisioning features enabled will have a an ACTIVE status with syncState as DISABLED.User ImportUsers imported and confirmed by an application with the IMPORT_PROFILE_UPDATES feature will have an ACTIVE status.  The application user’s syncState depends on whether the PROFILE_MASTERING feature is enabled for the application. When PROFILE_MASTERING is enabled the syncState transitions to SYNCHRONIZED otherwise the syncState is DISABLED.User ProvisioningUser provisioning in Okta is an asynchronous background job that is triggered during assignment of user (or indirectly via a group assignment).  User is assigned to an application that has PUSH_NEW_USERS feature enabled          Application user will have a STAGED status with no externalId while the background provisioning job is queued.        When the background provisioning job completes successfully, the application user transitions to the PROVISIONED status.           Application user is assigned an externalId when successfully provisioned in target application.  The externalId should be immutable for the life of the assignment        If the background provisioning job completes with an error, the application user remains with the STAGED status but will have syncState as ERROR.  A provisioning task is created in the Okta Admin UI that must be resolved to retry the job.When the PUSH_PROFILE_UPDATES feature is enabled, updates to an upstream profile are pushed downstream to the application according to profile mastering priority.  The app user’s syncState will have the following values:            syncState      Description                  OUT_OF_SYNC      Application user has changes that have not been pushed to the target application              SYNCING      Background provisioning job is running to update the user’s profile in the target application              SYNCHRONIZED      All changes to the app user profile have successfully been synchronized with the target application              ERROR      Background provisioning job failed to update the user’s profile in the target application. A provisioning task is created in the Okta Admin UI that must be resolved to retry the job.        User provisioning currently must be configured via the Okta Admin UI and is only available to with specific editions.Application User Credentials ObjectSpecifies a user’s credentials for the application.

SSO apps typically don’t support a user profile while apps with user provisioning features have an app-specific profiles with optional and/or required attributes.  Any profile attribute visible in the Okta Admin UI for an application assignment can also be assigned via the API. Some attributes are reference attributes and imported from the target application and only allow specific values to be configured.Profile Editor  Managing profiles for applications is restricted to specific editions and requires access to the Universal Directory Early Access featureExample Application AssignmentExample Profile Object{  \"profile\": {    \"secondEmail\": null,    \"lastName\": \"Jackson\",    \"mobilePhone\": null,    \"email\": \"saml.jackson@example.com\",    \"salesforceGroups\": [      \"Employee\"    ],    \"role\": \"CEO\",    \"firstName\": \"Saml\",    \"profile\": \"Standard User\"  }}Application Group ModelExample{  \"id\": \"00gbkkGFFWZDLCNTAGQR\",  \"lastUpdated\": \"2013-09-11T15:56:58.000Z\",  \"priority\": 0,  \"_links\": {    \"user\": {      \"href\": \"https://example.okta.com/api/v1/users/00ubgfEUVRPSHGWHAZRI\"    }  }}Application Group AttributesAll application groups have the following attributes:            Attribute      Description      DataType      MinLength      MaxLength      Nullable      Unique      Readonly                  id      unique key of group      String                    FALSE      TRUE      TRUE              lastUpdated      timestamp when app group was last updated      Date                    FALSE      FALSE      TRUE              priority      priority of group assignment      Number      0      100      TRUE      FALSE      FALSE              _links      discoverable resources related to the app group      JSON HAL                    TRUE      FALSE      TRUE      Application OperationsAdd ApplicationPOST /appsAdds a new application to your Okta organization.Request Parameters            Parameter      Description      Param Type      DataType      Required      Default                  app      App-specific name, signOnMode and settings      Body      Application      TRUE             Response ParametersAll responses return the created Application.Add Bookmark ApplicationAdds an new bookmark application to your organization.Settings            Attribute      Description      DataType      Nullable      Unique      Validation                  url      The URL of the launch page for this app      String      FALSE      FALSE      URL              requestIntegration      Would you like Okta to add an integration for this app?

It can be used as a standalone API to provide the identity layer on top of your existing application, or it can be integrated with the Okta Sessions API to obtain an Okta session cookie and access apps within Okta.  The API is targeted for developers who want to build their own end-to-end login experience to replace the built-in Okta login experience and addresses the following key scenarios:      Primary authentication allows you to verify username and password credentials for a user.        Multifactor authentication (MFA) strengthens the security of password-based authentication by requiring additional verification of another factor such as a temporary one-time password or an SMS passcode. The Auth API supports user enrollment with MFA factors enabled by the administrator, as well as MFA challenges based on your Sign-On security policy.        Recovery allows users to securely reset their password if they’ve forgotten it, or unlock their account if it has been locked out due to excessive failed login attempts. This functionality is subject to the security policy set by the administrator.    This API is currently in Early Access (EA) status.Authentication ModelThe Authentication API is a stateful API that implements a finite state machine with defined states and required transitions between those states.  State is transferred with a stateToken that is issued for each authentication or recovery transaction and must be passed with each request.  The Authentication API leverages the JSON HAL format to publish next and prev links for the current transaction state which should be used to transition the state machine.

POST to the next link relation to change the user’s expired password.              RECOVERY      The user has requested a recovery token to reset their password or unlock their account.      POST to the next link relation to answer the user’s recovery question.              PASSWORD_RESET      The user successfully answered their recovery question and must to set a new password.      POST to the next link relation to reset the user’s password.              LOCKED_OUT      The user account is locked; self-service unlock or admin unlock is required.      POST to the unlock link relation to perform a self-service unlock.              MFA_ENROLL      The user must select and enroll an available factor for additional verification.      POST to the enroll link relation for a specific factor to enroll the factor.              MFA_ENROLL_ACTIVATE      The user must activate the factor to complete enrollment.      POST to the next link relation to activate the factor.              MFA_REQUIRED      The user must provide additional verification with a previously enrolled factor.      POST to the verify link relation for a specific factor to provide additional verification.              MFA_CHALLENGE      The user must verify the factor-specific challenge.      POST to the verify link relation to verify the factor.              SUCCESS      The transaction has completed successfully             You can advance the authentication or recovery transaction to the next status by posting a status-specific request to the the next link relation published in the JSON HAL links object for the response.  Enrolling a factor and verifying a factor do not have next link relationships as the end-user must make a selection of which factor to enroll or verify.  You should never assume a specific state transition or URL when navigating the state model.  Always inspect the response for status and dynamically follow the published link relations.{  \"_links\": {    \"next\": {      \"name\": \"activate\",      \"href\": \"https://your-domain.okta.com/api/v1/authn/factors/ostf2xjtDKWFPZIKYDZV/lifecycle/activate\",      \"hints\": {        \"allow\": [          \"POST\"        ]      }    },    \"cancel\": {      \"href\": \"https://your-domain.okta.com/api/v1/authn/cancel\",      \"hints\": {        \"allow\": [          \"POST\"        ]      }    },    \"prev\": {      \"href\": \"https://your-domain.okta.com/api/v1/authn/previous\",      \"hints\": {        \"allow\": [          \"POST\"        ]      }    }  }}TokensAuthentication API operations will return different token types depending on the status of the authentication or recovery transaction.State TokenEphemeral token that encodes the current state of an authentication or recovery transaction.  The stateToken must be passed with every request except when verifying a recoveryToken that was distributed out-of-band  The stateToken is only intended to be used between the web application performing end-user authentication and the Okta API. It should never distributed to the end-user via email or other out-of-band mechanism.  The lifetime of the stateToken is currently fixed and not customizable.  All Authentication API operations will return 401 Unauthorized status code when you attempt to use an expired state token.HTTP/1.1 401 UnauthorizedContent-Type: application/json{    \"errorCode\": \"E0000011\",    \"errorSummary\": \"Invalid token provided\",    \"errorLink\": \"E0000011\",    \"errorId\": \"oaeY-4G_TBUTBSZAn9n7oZCfw\",    \"errorCauses\": []}  State transitions are strictly enforced for state tokens.  You will receive a 403 Forbidden status code if you attempt to use a state token for given status with invalid Authentication API operation for the status.HTTP/1.1 403 ForbiddenContent-Type: application/json{  \"errorCode\": \"E0000079\",  \"errorSummary\": \"This operation is not allowed in the current authentication state.\",  \"errorLink\": \"E0000079\",  \"errorId\": \"oaen9Ly_ivHQJ-STb8KiADh9w\",  \"errorCauses\": [    {      \"errorSummary\": \"This operation is not allowed in the current authentication state.\"    }  ]}Recovery TokenOne-time token issued as recoveryToken response parameter when a recovery transaction transitions to the RECOVERY status.  The token can be exchanged for a stateToken to recover a user’s password or unlock their account.  Unlike the statusToken the recoveryToken should be distributed out-of-band to a user such as via email.  The lifetime of the recoveryToken is managed by the organization’s security policy.  The recoveryToken is usually sent directly to the end-user via email or SMS.  Obtaining a recoveryToken is a highly privileged operation and should be restricted to trusted web applications.  Anyone that obtains a recoveryToken for a user and knows the answer to a user’s recovery question can reset their password or unlock their account.Session TokenOne-time token issued as sessionToken response parameter when an authentication transaction completes with the SUCCESS status.  The token can be exchanged for a session with the Session API or converted to a session cookie.  The lifetime of the sessionToken is the same as the lifetime of a user’s session and managed by the organization’s security policy.Factor ResultThe MFA_CHALLENGE state can return an additional attribute factorResult that provides additional context for the last factor verification attempt. The following table shows the possible values for this attribute.            factorResult      Description                  WAITING      Factor verification has started but not yet completed (e.g user hasn’t answered phone call yet)              CANCELLED      Factor verification was canceled by user              TIMEOUT      Unable to verify factor within the allowed time window              TIME_WINDOW_EXCEEDED      Factor was successfully verified but outside of the computed time window.  Another verification is required in current time window.              PASSCODE_REPLAYED      Factor was previously verified within the same time window.  User must wait another time window and retry with a new verification.              ERROR      Unexpected server error occurred verifying factor.      Links ObjectSpecifies link relations (See Web Linking) available for the current authentication status using the JSON Hypertext Application Language specification.  These links are used to transition the authentication status of the state token.            Link Relation Type      Description                  next      Transitions the authentication state machine to the next state.  Note: The name of the link relationship will provide a hint of the next operation required              prev      Transitions the authentication state machine to the previous state.              cancel      Cancels the current authentication transaction and revokes the state token.              resend      Resends a challenge or OTP to a device        The Links Object is read-onlyEmbedded ResourcesUser ObjectA subset of attributes of a User is available after successful primary authentication or during recovery.

The authentication status of the response will depend on the user’s group memberships and assigned policies.  Password Policy and Sign-On Policy is evaluated during primary authentication to determine if the user’s password is expired or if additional verification is required.  Primary Authentication with Invalid Credentials  Primary Authentication with Expired Password  Primary Authentication without Additional Verification  Primary Authentication with Additional Verification for Enrolled Factors  Primary Authentication with Factor Enrollment  You must first enable MFA factors for your organization and assign a MFA Sign-On Policy to a group to enroll and/or verify an additional factor during authenticationRequest Parameters            Parameter      Description      Param Type      DataType      MaxLength      Required      Default                  username      User’s non-qualified short-name (e.g. isaac) or unique fully-qualified login (e.g issac@example.org)      Body      String             TRUE                     password      User’s password credential      Body      String             TRUE                     relayState      Optional state value that is persisted for the lifetime of the authentication transaction      Body      String      2048      FALSE                     context      Provides additional context for the authentication transaction      Body      Context Object             FALSE             Context ObjectThe Authentication API derives default context from the HTTP request and client socket.  The context object allows trusted web applications to override the default context by forwarding the originating context in the primary authentication request.            Parameter      Description      Param Type      DataType      Required      Default                  ipAddress      IP Address of the user      Body      String      FALSE                     userAgent      User Agent of the user      Body      String      FALSE                     deviceToken      A globally unique ID identifying the device of the user      Body      String      FALSE               Sign-On Security Policy may optionally require MFA based on network location.  Overriding HTTP request context is a highly privileged operation that should be limited to trusted web applications.  Device TokenYou must always pass the same deviceToken for a user’s device with every authentication request for per-device or per-session Sign-On Policy factor challenges.  If the deviceToken is absent or does not match the previous deviceToken, the user will still be challenged everytime instead of per-device or per-session.  It is recommend that you generate a UUID or GUID for each client and persist the deviceToken as a persistent cookie or HTML5 localStorage item scoped to your web application’s origin.  The max length for deviceToken is 32 characters.Response ParametersAuthentication Object for the next authentication status.If the username or password is invalid you will receive a 401 Unauthorized status code with the following error: HTTP/1.1 401 UnauthorizedContent-Type: application/json{  \"errorCode\": \"E0000004\",  \"errorSummary\": \"Authentication failed\",  \"errorLink\": \"E0000004\",  \"errorId\": \"oaeuHRrvMnuRga5UzpKIOhKpQ\",  \"errorCauses\": []}Primary Authentication with Invalid CredentialsAuthenticates a user with an invalid username or password.Request Examplecurl -v -H \"Authorization: SSWS yourtoken\" \\-H \"Accept: application/json\" \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-X POST \"https://your-domain.okta.com/api/v1/authn-d \\'{  \"username\": \"isaac@example.org\",  \"password\" : \"GoAw@y123\",  \"relayState\": \"/myapp/some/deep/link/i/want/to/return/to\",  \"context\": {    \"ipAddress\": \"192.168.12.11\",    \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3)\",    \"deviceToken\": \"26q43Ak9Eh04p7H6Nnx0m69JqYOrfVBY\"  }}'Response ExampleHTTP/1.1 401 UnauthorizedContent-Type: application/json{  \"errorCode\": \"E0000004\",  \"errorSummary\": \"Authentication failed\",  \"errorLink\": \"E0000004\",  \"errorId\": \"oaeuHRrvMnuRga5UzpKIOhKpQ\",  \"errorCauses\": []}Primary Authentication with Expired PasswordAuthenticates a user with an expired password.

Okta reserves the right to add new parameters, properties, or resources to the API without advance notice. These updates are considered non-breaking and the compatibility rules below should be followed to ensure your application does not break. Breaking changes such as removing or renaming an attribute will be released as a new version of the API.  Okta will provide a migration path for new versions of APIs and will communicate timelines for end-of-life when deprecating APIs.Compatibility rules for input parameters  Requests are compatible irrespective of the order in which the query parameters appear.  Requests are compatible irrespective of the order in which the properties of the JSON parameters appear  New query parameters may be added to future versions of requests.  Existing query parameters cannot be removed from future versions of requests.  Existing properties cannot be removed from the JSON parameters in future versions of requests.Compatibility rules for JSON responses  Responses are compatible irrespective of the order in which the properties appear.  New properties may be added to future versions of the response.  Existing properties cannot be removed from future versions of the response.  Properties with null values may be omitted by responsesURL NamespaceAll URLs listed in the documentation should be preceded with your organization’s subdomain (tenant) https://{yoursubdomain}.okta.com/api/{apiversion} and API version.The apiversion is is currently v1.  All API requests must use HTTPS schemeMedia TypesThe API currently only supports JSON as an exchange format.  Be sure to set both the Content-Type and Accept headers for every request as application/json.All Date objects are returned in ISO 8601 format:YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZCharacter SetsOkta supports a subset of the UTF-8 specification. Specifically, any character that can be encoded in three bytes or less is supported. BMP characters and supplementary characters that must be encoded using four bytes are not supported at this time.HTTP VerbsWhere possible, the Okta API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for eachaction.GETUsed for retrieving resources.POSTUsed for creating resources, or performing custom actions (such asuser lifecycle operations).  POST requestswith no body param, be sure to set the Content-Length header to zero.PUTUsed for replacing resources or collections. For PUT requestswith no body param, be sure to set the Content-Length header to zero.DELETEUsed for deleting resources.  Any PUT or POST request with no Content-Length header nor a body will return a 411 error.  To get around this, either include a Content-Length: 0 headerErrorsAll requests on success will return a 200 status if there is content to return or a 204 status if there is no content to return.All requests that result in an error will return the appropriate 4xx or 5xx error code with a custom JSON error object:  errorCode: A code that is associated with this error type  errorLink: A link to documentation with a more detailed explanation of the error (note: this has yet to be implemented and for the time being is the same value as the errorCode)  errorSummary: A natural language explanation of the error  errorId: An id that identifies this request.  These ids are mapped to the internal error on the server side in order to assist in troubleshooting.{    \"errorCode\": \"E0000001\",    \"errorSummary\": \"Api validation failed\",    \"errorLink\": \"E0000001\",    \"errorId\": \"oaeHfmOAx1iRLa0H10DeMz5fQ\",    \"errorCauses\": [        {            \"errorSummary\": \"login: An object with this field already exists in the current organization\"        }    ]}See Error Codes for a list of API error codes.  Only the errorCode property is supported for runtime error flow control.  The errorSummary property is only to intended for troubleshooting and may change over timeAuthenticationThe Okta API currently requires the custom HTTP authentication scheme SSWS for authentication. All requests must have a valid API key specified in the HTTP Authorization header with the SSWS scheme.Authorization: SSWS 00QCjAl4MlV-WPXM…0HmjFx-vbGua  See Obtaining a token for instructions on how to get an API key for your organization.PaginationRequests that return a list of resources may support paging.  Pagination is based on cursor and not on page number. The cursor is opaque to the client and specified in either the ?before or ?after query parameter.  For some resources, you can also set a custom page size with the ?limit parameter.Note that for technical reasons not all APIs respect pagination or the ?limit parameter, see the Events API for example.            Param      Description                  before      This is the cursor that points to the start of the page of data that has been returned.              after      This is the cursor that points to the end of the page of data that has been returned.              limit      This is the number of individual objects that are returned in each page.      Link HeaderPagination links are included in the Link header of responses. It is important to follow these Link header values instead of constructing your own URLs as query parameters or  cursor formats may change without notice.HTTP/1.1 200 OKLink: &lt;https://yoursubdomain.okta.com/api/v1/users?after=00ubfjQEMYBLRUWIEDKK; rel=\"next\",  &lt;https://yoursubdomain.okta.com/api/v1/users?after=00ub4tTFYKXCCZJSGFKM&gt;; rel=\"self\"The possible rel values are:            Link Relation Type      Description                  self      Specifies the URL of the current page of results              next      Specifies the URL of the immediate next page of results.              prev      Specifies the URL of the immediate previous page of results.      When you first make an API call and get a cursor-paged list of objects, the end of the list will be the point at which you do not receive another next link value with the response. The behavior is different in the Events API. In the Events API, the next link always exists, since that connotation is more like a cursor or stream of data. The other APIs are primarily fixed data lengths.FilteringFiltering allows a requestor to specify a subset of resources to return and is often needed for large collection resources such as Users.  While filtering semantics are standardized in the Okta API, not all resources in the Okta API support filtering. When filtering is supported for a resource, the filter URL query parameter contains a filter expression.The expression language that is used in the filter parameter supports references to JSON attributes and literals. The literal values can be strings enclosed in double quotes, numbers, date times enclosed in double quotes, and Boolean values; i.e., true or false. String literals must be valid JSON strings.The attribute names are case-sensitive while attribute operators are case-insensitive. For example, the following two expressions will evaluate to the same logical value:filter=firstName Eq \"john\"filter=firstName eq \"john\"The filter parameter must contain at least one valid Boolean expression. Each expression must contain an attribute name followed by an attribute operator and optional value. Multiple expressions may be combined using the two logical operators. Furthermore expressions can be grouped together using “()”.  Each resource in the Okta API defines what attributes and operators are supported for expression.  Please refer to resource-specific documentation for details.OperatorsThe operators supported in the expression are listed in the following table.            Operator      Description      Behavior                  eq      equal      The attribute and operator values must be identical for a match.              co      contains      The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value for a match.              sw      starts with      The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, starting at the beginning of the attribute value. This criterion is satisfied if the two strings are identical.              pr      present (has value)      If the attribute has a non-empty value, or if it contains a non-empty node for complex attributes there is a match.              gt      greater than      If the attribute value is greater than operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For String attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison and for Date types, it is a chronological comparison.              ge      greater than or equal      If the attribute value is greater than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For String attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison and for Date types, it is a chronological comparison.              lt      less than      If the attribute value is less than operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For String attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison and for Date types, it is a chronological comparison.              le      less than or equal      If the attribute value is less than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For String attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison and for Date types, it is a chronological comparison.      Note: Some resources do not support all operators.  All Date values use the ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZAttribute Operators            Operator      Description      Behavior                  and      Logical And      The filter is only a match if both expressions evaluate to true.              or      Logical or      The filter is a match if either expression evaluates to true.      Logical Operators            Operator      Description      Behavior                  ()      Precedence grouping      Boolean expressions may be grouped using parentheses to change the standard order of operations; i.e., evaluate OR logical operators before logical AND operators.      Filters must be evaluated using standard order of operations. Attribute operators have the highest precedence, followed by the grouping operator (i.e, parentheses), followed by the logical AND operator, followed by the logical OR operator.HypermediaResources in the Okta API use hypermedia for “discoverability”.  Hypermedia enables API clients to navigate  resources by following links like a web browser instead of hard-coding URLs in your application.  Links are identified by link relations which are named keys. Link relations describe what resources are available and how they can be interacted with.  Each resource may publish a set of link relationships based on the state of the resource.  For example, the status of a user in the User API will govern which lifecycle operations are permitted.  Only the permitted operations will be published a lifecycle operations.The Okta API had incorporated JSON Hypertext Application Language or HAL format as the foundation for hypermedia “discoverability.  HAL provides a set of conventions for expressing hyperlinks in JSON responses representing two simple concepts: Resources and Links.  The HAL-specific media type application/hal+json is currently not supported as a formal media type for content negotiation at this time.  Use the standard application/json media type.  As we get more experience with the media format we may add support for the media type.ResourcesA Resource Object represents a resource.      \"_links\" contains links to other resources.        \"_embedded\" contains embedded resources.  All other properties represent the current state of the resource.LinksObject whose property names are link relation types (as defined by RFC5988) and values are either a Link Object or an array of Link Objects.  A target URI  The name of the link relation (rel)  A few other optional properties to help with deprecation, content negotiation, etc.  A resource may have multiple links that share the same link relation.{    \"_links\": {        \"self\": { \"href\": \"/example_resource\" },        \"next\": { \"href\": \"/page=2\" }    }}Rate LimitingThe number of API requests for an organization is limited for all APIs based on your edition.The following three headers are set in each response:X-Rate-Limit-Limit - the rate limit ceiling that is applicable for the current request.X-Rate-Limit-Remaining - the number of requests left for the current rate-limit window.X-Rate-Limit-Reset - the remaining time in the current rate-limit window before the rate limit resets, in UTC epoch seconds.HTTP/1.1 200 OKX-RateLimit-Limit: 20X-RateLimit-Remaining: 15X-RateLimit-Reset: 1366037820If the rate limit is exceeded, an HTTP 429 Status Code is returned.  The current Rate Limit is on a per-org per-endpoint basis.Rate limits are enforced for all organizations.Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows a web page to make an AJAX call using XMLHttpRequest (XHR) to a domain that is  different from the one from where the script was loaded.  Such “cross-domain” requests would otherwise be forbidden by web browsers, per the same origin security policy.  CORS defines a standardized way in which the browser and the server can interact to determine whether or not to allow the cross-origin request.In Okta, CORS allows JavaScript hosted on your websites to make an XHR to the Okta API with the Okta session cookie. Every website orgin must be explictly permitted via the Okta Admin Dashboard for CORS.  See Enabling CORS for details on how to allow your website to make cross-orgin requests.  Caution: Only grant access to specific orgins (websites) that you control and trust to access the Okta API.API SupportThe Okta API supports CORS on an API by API basis. If you’re building an application that needs CORS, please check that the specific operation supports CORS for your use case. APIs that support CORS are marked with the following icon  CORS."

The API is intended to export event data as a batch job from your organization to another system for reporting or analysis.Event ModelEvery organization has a system log that maintains a history of actions performed by users.  The Event model describes a single action that was performed by a set of actors for a set of targets.Example{   \"eventId\":\"tevGr2BhQTMR72OiBGvKXTp2Q1399593071000\",   \"published\":\"2014-05-08T23:51:11.000Z\",   \"requestId\":\"req8U_MHmEbSai_0I4RopTnfA\",   \"sessionId\":\"000cWiYg47QSFyk1YjE6cDcEg\",   \"action\":{      \"message\":\"Okta user created\",      \"categories\":[         \"User Creation\"      ],      \"objectType\":\"core.user.config.user_creation.success\",      \"requestUri\":\"Background\"   },   \"actors\":[      {         \"id\":\"00ue1aWYUCUFFKXLXELW\",         \"displayName\":\"Add-Min O'Cloudy Tud\",         \"login\":\"administrator1@clouditude.net\",         \"objectType\":\"User\"      },      {         \"id\":\"Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1\",         \"displayName\":\"UNKNOWN\",         \"ipAddress\":\"\",         \"objectType\":\"Client\"      }   ],   \"targets\":[      {         \"id\":\"00ue1gAKBMCSWHRZYDJS\",         \"displayName\":\"Inca-Louise O'Rain Dum\",         \"login\":\"inca@clouditude.net\",         \"objectType\":\"User\"      }   ]   }AttributesThe Event model is a read-only object and has a fixed set of attributes:            Attribute      Description      DataType      Nullable                  eventId      Unique key for event      String      FALSE              published      Timestamp when event was published      Date      TRUE              requestId      Identifies the request      String      TRUE              sessionId      Session in which the event occurred      String      TRUE              action      Identifies the action that the event describes      Action Object      FALSE              actors      Describes zero or more entities that performed the action      Array of Actor Object      TRUE              targets      Describes zero or more entities that the action was performed against      Array of Target Object      TRUE        The actor and/or target of an event is dependent on the action performed. Not all events have an actor or target.  A single requestID can identify multiple events.  The sessionID can identify multiple requests. Use the sessionID to link events and requests that occurred in the same session.Action ObjectDescribes an activity that published an event            Attribute      Description      DataType      Nullable                  message      Description of an action      String      FALSE              categories      Categories for an action      Array of String      FALSE              objectType      Identifies the unique type of an action      String      FALSE              requestUri      Uri of the request that generated the event.

It provides operations to activate or deactivate which factor types are available to use for multi-factor authentication. Activating a factor type with this API does not enable multi-factor authentication. It makes an activated factor available for multi-factor authentication only. After activating a facor with this API, it cannot be used until you enable a policy that uses this factor. If there is only one factor enabled in the policy, this API cannot disable that factor.  This API is currently in Beta status and provides no guarantees for backwards-compatibility.  Okta is free to break this API until it is released.Postman TemplateIn Postman, navigate to Import Collections and paste in the following URL: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/cc626f09c9346ad88f66Factor Model            Attribute      Description      DataType      MinLength      MaxLength      Nullable      Unique      Readonly                  id      the factor name      Factor Name                    FALSE      TRUE      TRUE              provider      factor provider      Provider Type                    FALSE      TRUE      TRUE              factorType      type of factor      Factor Type                    FALSE      TRUE      TRUE              status      status of factor      NOT_SETUP, PENDING_ACTIVATION,  ACTIVE, INACTIVE                    FALSE      FALSE      TRUE              _links      discoverable resources related to the factor      JSON HAL                    FALSE      FALSE      TRUE      Factor NameThe following factor names are available:            Factor Name      Description                  okta_otp      Okta Verify              google_otp      Google Authenticator              okta_sms      SMS Authentication              symantec_vip      Symantec VIP              rsa_token      RSA SecurID              okta_question      Security Question      Factor TypeThe following factor types are supported:            Factor Type      Description                  sms      SMS              token      A software or hardware one-time password OTP device              token:software:totp      Software Time-based One-time Password (TOTP)              question      Additional security question      Provider TypeThe following providers are supported:            Provider      Description                  OKTA      Okta              RSA      RSA SecurID Integration              SYMANTEC      Symantec VIP Integration              GOOGLE      Google Integration      Links ObjectSpecifies link relations (See Web Linking) available for the current status of a factor using the JSON Hypertext Application Language specification.

Phone numbers that are not formatted in E.164 may work, but it depends on the phone or handset that is being used as well as the carrier from which the call or SMS is being originated.For example, to convert a US phone number (415 599 2671) to E.164 format, one would need to add the ‘+’ prefix and the country code (which is 1) in front of the number (+1 415 599 2671). In the UK and many other countries internationally, local dialing requires the addition of a 0 in front of the subscriber number. However, to use E.164 formatting, this 0 must be removed. A number such as 020 7183 8750 in the UK would be formatted as +44 20 7183 8750.TOTP ProfileSpecifies the profile for a token:software:totp factor            Attribute      Description      DataType      MinLength      MaxLength      Nullable      Unique      Readonly                  credentialId      unique id for instance      String                    FALSE      FALSE      TRUE      \"profile\": {  \"credentialId\": \"isaac@example.org\"}Links ObjectSpecifies link relations (See Web Linking) available for the current status of a factor using the JSON Hypertext Application Language specification.

Need Help?        Okta Application Network FAQsOverviewWith over 4000 pre-integrated applications, the Okta Application Network (OAN) provides a great way for ISVs to integrate with an enterprise grade identity management solution. The goal of the OAN is to take the burden of integration away from your customers while providing a simple, standards-based methodology for your application to support federated single sign-on, automated provisioning, and directory integration. By integrating with Okta, your application also benefits from other powerful features such as advanced password policy and multi-factor authentication (MFA).There are two main area of focus – Authentication and Provisioning. You need to support at least one of these features in order to be part of Okta Application Network. Okta strongly recommends that you implement both.AuthenticationYour application needs to support Federated Single Sign-On, a common approach for an application to rely on an external identity provider. For web-based applications, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the standard. For mobile applications, many mobile solution vendors offer proprietary SDKs to provide support. Okta offers Okta Mobile Connect which is based on the SAML protocol.For details on how to federate your application with SAML and Okta Mobile Connect, go to our Single Sign-On with Okta section for additional guidance.ProvisioningSingle sign-on is just one aspect of federation. First, an account for the user must be created to grant access to your application. In order to “automate” this process, your application should expose APIs to manage the account lifecycle that account creation, user profile updates, authorization settings (such as groups or roles), account deactivation, etc.While many ISVs use proprietary APIs, Okta recommends that you implement your API using the Simple Cloud Identity Management protocol which supports all of the key features needed in provisioning.For details on how to implement provisioning for your application, go to our “… SCIM Guidance page”Getting StartedUse the following instructions to integrate your app into the Okta Application Network:1. Review Pre-Integration Resources      Is supporting single sign-on making you anxious? Use our Single Sign-On with Okta tools which includes toolkits and even a tool for testing your SAML configuration.        Ready to offload user on-boarding with Okta? Find recommendations on building APIs for user creation, update, and deactivation in our Building a Well-Managed Cloud Application guide.  2. Integrate Your App  Sign up for an Okta developer account.  Use the App Wizard to integrate single sign-on after you sign into Okta as an admin. For more details, see our videos for SAML and SWA.  Currently provisioning integrations are custom-built by Okta. Email &#111;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#111;&#107;&#116;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; to submit a request for your app.  Get Stuck? See our Okta Application Network FAQs below.3. Partner with OktaAlready integrated? Become an Okta App Partner. Benefits include direct access to Okta support, marketing support, and a free version of Okta for your app.4. Need Help?Ask questions and get help by emailing &#100;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#111;&#107;&#116;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; or post your questions on stackoverflow.Okta Application Network FAQsQ: Do I need to contact Okta first to start integrating my application?A: You should start by enabling SSO and provisioning with your application. Use the material on this site to help with your implementation. There are instructions on how to test your implementation as well.Q: I am having issues integrating my app or have questions about single sign-on support in my app. How do I contact Okta?A: If you have any technical questions, you can submit them to &#100;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#111;&#107;&#116;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; or post your questions on stackoverflow.Q: Where can I get a free Okta account to play around with?A: Sign up for an Okta Developer Edition account.Q: Are there any cost associated with joining the Okta Application Network (OAN)?A: No, integrating your application with the Okta Application Network is completely FREE. Also, Okta’s paid SSO and Enterprise customers can utilize all application integrations in the OAN free of charge.Q: By following the guidance here, am I building an integration that only works with Okta? What about other identity vendors?A: Absolutely not. Our goal is to help you identity-enable your application using industry standards. The guidance offered here for SAML and SCIM allows you to integrate with customers using other identity solutions.Q: My customer is asking for AD (Active Directory) integration. Is that SSO, provisioning, or both?A: AD (and LDAP) play a role in both SSO and provisioning. For SSO, customers often want end users to be able to log into SaaS applications with their corporate password. When you integrate with Okta through SAML, authentication is done by Okta, and Okta supports delegated authentication against AD. For provisioning, Okta acts as a universal directory containing all the information about the AD user. During provisioning, Okta can push information such as user profile, manager, security group membership to your application if needed. Effectively, Okta acts as a cloud representation of your customers’ AD that makes integration much simpler for your application.Q: What is Secure Web Authentication (SWA)?A: SWA was developed by Okta to provide single sign-on for apps that do not support federated sign-on methods. Users can still sign in directly through the application and then enter their credentials for these apps on their Okta homepage. These credentials are stored such that users can access their apps with a single sign-on. When users first sign-in to a SWA app from their homepage, they see a pop-up message asking if they were able to sign-in successfully.Q: What is the process after I have submitted my app using the App Wizard?A: Okta App Integration team reviews all submitted apps. The team will reach out during the testing and documentation process for additional information. When completed, the application is then be promoted to the public Okta Application Network, and you are notified. Typical review time is two weeks. Have you submitted an app but have not heard from Okta? Email &#100;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#111;&#107;&#116;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;.Q: What is the difference between Community Created and Okta Verified in the Okta Application Network?A: There are two different levels of app integrations in the OAN – Okta Verified and Community Created. Okta Verified apps have custom configuration documentation and are tested by Okta initially and on an ongoing basis. All other apps are labeled as Community Created and have not been tested and verified by Okta.Q: I’m setting up a SAML 2.0 app using the App Wizard and we have different domains for each customer. How do you manage these types of situations?A: Currently, the App Wizard does not support custom domains. Create an app using the Template SAML 2.0 Application. In order to promote your Template App to the Okta Application Network, please email a screenshot of the configured app details to oan@okta.com with your app name in the subject line.Q: My app currently supports WS-FED for SSO. Can I use the App Wizard?A: The Okta App Wizard only supports SAML 2.0 for federated SSO. If your app supports WS-Fed, you will instead need to create a WS-Fed Template App. Once completed, the Template Application you have created will only be able to be used within your account. In order to promote your Template App to the Okta Application Network, please email a screenshot of the configured app details to oan@okta.com with your app name in the subject line.Q: I am creating a SWA using the App Wizard but I realize my application has additional fields on the login page beyond the standard username and password (example: Customer / OrgID). Can an app with additional fields like this on the login be configured using the App Wizard?A: Currently, the App Wizard does not support extra login fields. Create an app using the Plug-in (SWA) Template Application. In order to promote your Template App to the Okta Application Network, please email a screenshot of the configured app details to &#111;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#111;&#107;&#116;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; with your app name in the subject line.Q: Does Okta support single logout / single sign-out (SAML protocol)?A: No, Okta does not currently support single logout / single sign-out (SAML protocol).Q: Is the IDP session time out a setting that an Okta admin can change? And if so, can it be changed on a per application basis, or is it a global setting for all of the user’s applications?A: Yes, the session time out default is 2 hours but can be customized by the hour or minute by the Okta administrator. This session time out is an IDP setting – and therefire, it is global and applies to all applications.Q: My app is now in OAN, what is the user experience for a joint customer that wants to set up SSO and Account Provisioning for my app in the Okta interface?A: Okta creates unique SAML configuration documentation for each application in the OAN so each will be different but for a sample, see our instructions for “How to Configure SAML 2.0 in Slack” as an example. Also, if you haven’t already done so, sign up for an Okta developer account and you can test drive the Okta user experience yourself.Q: In general, how can I get familiar with the Okta product?A: To get started, check out our Training Resources or Okta Academy on Youtube. Also see the Okta Help Center for FAQs and support articles and the Okta Community. App Partners are eligible for live Okta 101 sessions as well, please email &#111;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#111;&#107;&#116;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; if you are interested."

For example, you might use a custom expression to create a username by stripping @company.com from an email address.  Or you might combine firstName and lastName attributes into a single displayName attribute.This document details the features and syntax of Okta’s Expression Language which can be used throughout the Okta Admin Console and API. This document will be updated over time as new capabilities are added to the language.  Okta’s expression language is based on SpEL and uses a subset of functionalities offered by SpEL.Referencing User AttributesWhen you create an Okta expression, you can reference any attribute that lives on an Okta user profile or App user profile.Okta user profileEvery user has an Okta user profile.  The Okta user profile is the central source of truth for a user’s core attributes.  To reference an Okta user profile attribute, just reference user and specify the attribute variable name.            Syntax      Definitions      Examples                  user.$attribute      user reference to the Okta user$attribute the attribute variable name      user.firstNameuser.lastNameuser.usernameuser.email      Application user profileIn addition to an Okta user profile, all users have separate Application user profiles for each of their applications.  The Application user profiles are used to store application specific information about a user, such as application username or user role.  To reference an App user profile attribute, just specify the application variable and the attribute variable in that application’s App user profile. In specifying the application you can either name the specific application you’re referencing or use an implicit reference to an in-context application.            Syntax      Definitions      Examples                  $appuser.$attribute      $appUser explicit reference to specific app$attribute the attribute variable name      zendesk.firstNameactive_directory.managerUpngoogle_apps.email              appuser.$attribute      appUser implicit reference to in-context app$attribute the attribute variable name      appUser.firstName        With Universal Directory, there are about 30 attributes in the base Okta profile and any number of custom attributes can be added.  All App user profiles have a username attribute and possibly others depending on the application.   To find a full list of Okta user and App user attributes and their variable names, go to People &gt; Profile Editor.  If you’re not yet using Universal Directory, contact your Support or Professional Services team.Referencing Application and Organization PropertiesIn addition to referencing user attributes, you can also reference App properties, and the properties of your Organization.

These operation apply to various policies including Okta Signon.This API supports the following policy operations:  Get all policies of a specific type  Create, read, update, and delete a policy  Activate and deactivate a policyThis API supports the following rule operations:  Get all rules for a policy  Create, read, update, and delete a rule for a policy  Activate and deactivate a rule  This API is currently in Early Access (EA) status.PoliciesPolicy Model and DefaultsDefault PoliciesThere is always a default policy created for each type of policy. The default policy applies to any users for whom other policies in the org do not apply. This ensures that there is always a policy to apply to a user in all situations.       A default policy is required and cannot be deleted.        The default policy is always the last policy in the priority order. Any added policies of this type have higher priority than the default policy.         The default policy always has one default rule that cannot be deleted. It is always the last rule in the priority order. If you add rules to the default policy, they have a higher priority than the default rule. For information on default rules, see Rules Model and Defaults.        The system attribute determines whether a policy is created by a system or by a user.  Policy ModelPolicies and rules are ordered numerically by priority. This priority determines the order in which they are searched for a context match. The highest priority policy has a priorityOrder of 1.For example, assume the following conditions are in effect.  Rule A has priority 1 and applies to RADIUS VPN scenarios.  Rule B has priority 2 and applies to ON_NETWORK scenarios.Because Rule A has a higher priority, even though requests are coming from ON_NETWORK due to VPN,the action in Rule A is taken, and Rule B is not evaluated.Policy ObjectThe Policy model defines several attributes:            Parameter      Description      Data Type      Required      Default                  id      Identifier for the policy      String      No      Assigned              type      Policy type –  must be OKTA_SIGN_ON      String      Yes                     name      Name for the policy      String      Yes                     description      Description for the policy      String      No      Null              priorityOrder      Priority for the policy      Int      No      Last / Lowest Priority              system      Whether or not the policy is the default      Boolean      No      false              status      Status of the policy: ACTIVE or INACTIVE      String      No      “ACTIVE”              created      Timestamp when the policy was created      Date      No      Assigned              lastUpdated      Timestamp when the policy was last modified      Date      No      Assigned      People ObjectThe people condition identifies users and groups that are used together.

The default rule cannot be edited or deleted.        The default rule is required and always is the last rule in the priority order. If you add rules to the default policy, they have a higher priority than the default rule.        The system attribute determines whether a rule is created by a system or by a user. The default rule is the only rule that has this attribute.  Rules ObjectThe Rules model defines several attributes:            Parameter      Description      Data Type      Required      Default                  id      Identifier for the rule      String      No      Assigned              type      Rule type –  must be SIGN_ON      String      Yes                     name      Name for the rule      String      Yes                     status      Status of the rule: ACTIVE or INACTIVE      String      No      ACTIVE              priorityOrder      Priority for the rule      Int      No      Last / Lowest Priority              system      Whether or not the rule is the default      Boolean      No      false              created      Timestamp when the rule was created      Date      No      Assigned              lastUpdated      Timestamp when the rule was last modified      Date      No      Assigned      ConditionsRule conditions include the people, user, and group conditions from the policy model in addition to:Network Condition BodySpecifies a network segment.

				"content"  : "This guide describes how to use PySAML2 to add supportfor Okta (via SAML) to applications written in Python. Please note that while the example in this guide usesFlask, the concepts presented here are general enough to use in other Python frameworks.This guide describes how to install and configure an exampleapplication that demonstrates how to use PySAML2 in a Flask application.After you have Okta working with the example application,adapt the example code for your production environment.This guide assumes that you are familiar with the basics of Pythonsoftware development: using the command line, editing text files,using virtualenv, and usingpip.If you’re already familiar with Okta, you can skip to thesection titled “Configuring PySAML2 to work with Okta.”  Configuring Okta to work with PySAML2  Configuring PySAML2 to work with Okta  Test the SAML integration  Next StepsConfiguring Okta to work with PySAML2Before you can configure your application and PySAML2 set up anOkta “chiclet” (application icon) that enables an Okta user to sign in to your to your application with SAML and PySAML2.To set up Okta to connect to your application, follow thesetting up a SAML application in Oktaguide. As noted in the instructions, there are two steps to change:  In step #6: Use PySAML2 Example instead of Example SAML application .      In step #7: When entering the URL    http://example.com/saml/sso/example-okta-com    use the following:    http://localhost:5000/saml/sso/example-okta-com    Note: “5000” is the port that Flask uses by default, if you are using a different port number, change “5000” to the port number you are using.  Configuring PySAML2 to work with OktaNow that you have configured the PySAML2 Example “chiclet” in your Okta organization, youare ready to configure PySAML2 to work with your Okta organization. In thissection wuse the “Identity Provider metadata” link from thesection above to configure PySAML2. After completingthe following steps, you will have a working example of connecting Okta to a sample Python application using PySAML2.      Download the example application for Python:    $ git clone git@github.com:jpf/okta-pysaml2-example.git        cd to the okta-pysaml2-example directory.    $ cd okta-pysaml2-example        Open the app.py file in your favorite text editor.    $ $EDITOR app.py        After opening the app.py file, modify the contents of the metadata_url_for dictionary as shown below.    metadata_url_for = {    'example-okta-com': '{metadata-url}'}        Be sure to replace the contents of {metdata-url} with the linkthat you copied in step #10 of the“Setting up a SAML application in Okta”instructions that you followed above!    Note: The contents of {metadata-url} should look similar to: https://example.oktapreview.com/app/a0b1c2deFGHIJKLMNOPQ/sso/saml/metadata        Install the dependencies; for example, Python SAML SP:    $ virtualenv venv$ source venv/bin/activate$ pip install -r requirements.txt        Start the Python example:    $ python app.py  Test the SAML integrationNow that you have set up an application in your Okta organization and haveconfigured PySAML2 to work with your Okta organization, it is ready to test.There are two ways to test a SAML application:  Starting from the example Python application (“SP initiated”).  Starting from Okta (“IdP initiated”).You will use both methods to test your application. In each case, you will know iff thetest worked when you see a screen that looks like the one below:      Login from the Okta PySAML2 example application (This isknown as an SP-initiated login.)                  Start the example application from the command line:        $ source venv/bin/activate$ python app.py                    Open the example application in your browser:http://localhost:5000/                    Click on the link for your Okta IdP.                  Login from Okta (This is known as an IdP-initiated” login.)                  Start the example application from the command line:        $ source venv/bin/activate$ python app.py                    Sign in to your Okta organization.                    Click the button for the application you created earlier“Configuring Okta to work with PySAML2” sectionabove:            If you can to get to the “Logged in” page using both of themethods above, the test are successful.Congratulations on getting Okta working with PySAML2!Next StepsAt this point, you should be familiar with setting up a SAML enabled applicationto work with an Okta organization and how to configure PySAML2 to work with Okta.After you have your Okta organization working with the example Pythonapplication, the next step is to take the example code and moveit to your production application. The specifics of how this works isdifferent depending on how your application is setup. Pay special attention to the notes in the app.py file. Forexample, on a production system, the contents of themetadata_url_for dictionary cannot be hard coded, but must comefrom a dynamic datastore.If you want to learn more about SAML and what to consider when writing a SAML implementation, Okta’sin-depth SAML guidanceis a great place to learn more.Finally, if you got this far in this guide and still have questions,please reach out to me at: joel.franusic@okta.com."

To obtain information about users such as user profile and group information, many of these applications are built to integrate with corporate directories such as Microsoft Active Directory.  More importantly, a user’s credentials are typically stored and validated using the directory.  For example, if you use SharePoint and Exchange that are running on premises, your login credentials are your Active Directory credentials.However, with increased collaboration and the move towards the cloud, many applications have moved beyond the boundaries of a company’s domain.   Federated Authentication is the solution to this problem.AuthenticationBefore diving into federated authentication, we need to understand what authentication really means.  Authentication defines the way a user is identified and validated through some sort of credentials as part of a login flow.  Most applications will present a login page to an end user, allowing him to specify a username and a password.  In some cases, additional information may be required in order to locate the user - like a company ID or a client code.  This information allows the application to narrow down the search of the username applicable to the provided info.  This is often used to allow the same username to exist across multiple tenants belonging to different customers.Most applications will have a user store (DB or LDAP) containing amongst many things - user profile information and credentials.  During login, the credentials are validated against this backend user store.  The advantage of this approach is that it is simple as everything is managed within the application, providing a single and consistent way to authenticate an end user.  However, if a user needs to access multiple applications where each app requires a different set of credentials, it becomes a hassle for the end user.  Firstly, the user will need to remember different passwords – in addition to any other corporate password (eg. AD password) that may already exist.   The user is now forced to maintain separate usernames and passwords, dealing with different password policies and expirations.  It also creates a headache for administrators and ISVs when application users continue to have access to applications when access should have been revoked.Federated IdentityFederated Identity started with the need to support application access spanning outside a company or organization boundary.  Imagine a relationship between a juice company (JuiceCo) selling its product to a large supermarket chain (BigMart).  As an employee of JuiceCo, you need to access an application provided by BigMart to manage the relationship and monitor supplies and sales.In this case, BigMart (who is providing this application) will need to take care of user authentication.  The simple way is to require a different user name and password from users working at JuiceCo.  But think about all the users that this application will need to maintain – including all the other suppliers and their users needing to access the application.A more elegant way to solve this problem is to allow JuiceCo and every other supplier to share or “federate” the identities with BigMart.  As an employee of JuiceCo, you already have a corporate identity and credentials, What Federated Identity provides is a secure way for the supermarket chain (Service Provider) to externalize authentication by integrating with its suppliers’ existing identity infrastructure (Identity Provider).  This type of use case is what led to the birth of federated protocols such as Secure Assertion Markup Languange (SAML).See Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0 Technical Overview for a in-depth overview.Planning for SAMLSAML is mostly used as a web-based authentication mechanism as it relies on the browser being used as an agent that brokers the authentication flow.  At high-level, the authentication flow of SAML looks like thisWe are now ready to introduce some common SAML terms.  We will go into the technical details of these later – but it is important to understand the high-level concept during the planning stage.      A Service Provider (SP) is the entity providing the service – typically in the form of an application        An Identity Provider (IDP) is the entity providing the identities including the ability to authenticate a user.  The Identity Provider typically also contains the user profile – additional information about the user such as first name, last name, job code, phone number, address, etc.  Depending on the application, some service providers may require a very simple profile (username, email) while others may require a richer set of user data (job code, department, address, location, manager, etc.        A SAML Request, also known as an authentication request, is generated by the Service Provider to “request” for an authentication.        A SAML Response is generated by the Identity Provider.  It contains the actual assertion of the authenticated user.  In addition, a SAML Response may contain additional information such as user profile information and group/role information depending on what the Service Provider can support        A Service Provider Initiated (SP-initiated) login describes the SAML login flow when initiated by the Service Provider.  This is typically triggered when the end user tries to access a resource or login directly on the Service Provider side – ie. The browser is trying to access a protected resource on the Service Provider side.        An Identity Provider Initiated (IDP-initiated) login describes the SAML login flow initiated by the Identity Provider.  The SAML flow is not triggered due to a redirection from the Service Provider.  The Identity Provider initiates a SAML Response that is redirected to the Service Provider to assert the user’s identity.  A couple of key things to note:      The Service Provider never directly interacts with the Identity Provider.  A browser acts as the agent to carries out all the redirections.        The Service Provider needs to know which Identity Provider to redirect to before it has any idea who the user is.        The Service Provider does not know who the user is until the SAML assertion comes back from the Identity Provider.        This flow does not have to start from the Service Provider.  An Identity Provider can initiate an authentication flow.        The SAML authentication flow is asynchronous.  The Service Provider does not know if the Identity Provider will ever complete the entire flow.  Because of this, the Service Provider does not maintain any state of any authentication requests generated.  When the Service Provider receives a response from an Identity Provider, the response must contain all the necessary information.  Planning ChecklistWhile the SAML protocol is a standard, there are different ways to implement it based on the nature of your application.  The following is a checklist that will guide you through some of key considerations.      Understanding the role of a Service Provider        Single IDP vs Multiple IDPs        Understanding SP-initiated Login Flow        Exposing SAML configuration in SP        Enabling SAML for everyone vs a subset of users        Implementing a “backdoor”  Understanding the role of a Service ProviderA SAML IDP generates a SAML response based on configuration that is mutually agreed upon by the IDP and the SP.  Upon receiving the SAML assertion, SP needs to validate that the assertion comes from a valid IDP and then parses the necessary information from the assertion – the username, attributes, etc.In order to do this, the SP requires at a minimum the following:  Certificate – SP needs to obtain the public certificate from the IDP to validate the signature.  The certificate is stored on the SP side and used whenever a SAML response arrives  ACS Endpoint – Assertion Consumer Service URL – often referred to simply as the SP login URL.  This is the endpoint provided by the SP where SAML responses are posted.  SP needs to provide this information to the IDP  IDP Login URL – This is the endpoint on the IDP side where SAML requests are posted.  SP needs to obtain this information from the IDP.The easiest way to implement SAML is to leverage an OpenSource SAML toolkits.  At the end of this article, we have included a list of recommended toolkits for several languages.  These toolkits provide the logic to digest the information in an incoming SAML Response.  In addition, if SP needs to support SP-initiated Login flow, the toolkits also provide the logic to generate an appropriate SAML Authentication Request.Single IDP vs Multiple IDPsIf you are building an internal app and you want to SAML-enable it in order to integrate with your corporate SAML identity provider, then you are looking at supporting only a single IDP.  In this case, your app only needs to deal with a single set of IDP metadata (cert, endpoints, etc).If you are an ISV building an enterprise SaaS product – or if you are building an external facing website/portal/community for your customers and partners, then you need to look at supporting multiple IDPs.  This is the typical use case for many SaaS ISVs needing to integrate with customers’ corporate identity infrastructure.  Depending on the architecture of your application, you need to think about ways to store the SAML configuration (eg. Certificates, IDP login URLs) from each identity provider – and also providing the needed SP information for each.A key consideration involves the ACSurl endpoint on the SP side where SAML responses are posted. It is possible to expose a single endpoint even when dealing with multiple IDPs.  For a single-instance multi-tenant application where the tenancy is not defined in the URL (ie. via a subdomain, for eg.) this might be a simpler way to implement.  However, you must then rely on additional information in the SAML response to figure out which IDP is trying to authenticate (eg. using the IssuerID).  If your application is architected in a multi-tenant fashion with domain information in the URL – (eg. https://domain1.myISV.com or https://www.myISV.com/domain1), then having an ACSurl endpoint for each subdomain might be a good option since the URL itself identifies the domain.Understanding SP-initiated Login FlowAs discussed earlier, an IDP-initiated login flow starts from the IDP.  Since it begins on the IDP side, there is no additional context about what the user is trying to access on the SP side other than the fact that the user is trying to get authenticated and access the SP.  Typically, once the user is authenticated, the browser will be taken to a generic landing page in the SP.In an SP-initiated flow, the user tries to access a protected resource directly on the SP side without the IDP being aware of the attempt.  Two issues arise.  First is the need to identify the right IDP if authentication of a federated identity is needed.  With SP-initiated login, the SP initially does not know anything about the identity.  As a developer, you need to figure out how the SP can figure out which IDP should be receiving the SAML request.  In some cases, if your application URLs contain subdomain information that is mapped to a unique tenant and IDP, then the resource link being hit is enough to identify the IDP.  If this isn’t the case, then you might need to prompt for additional information from the end user – for eg. a user id, email or a company id – something that allows the SP to figure out which IDP the user attempting to access the resource belongs to.  Remember, you are only prompting for an identifier – not credentials.Another issue with SP-initated login flow is the support for deep-links. Most applications support deep-links.  For eg., you might receive a link to a document that resides on a content management system.  Ideally, if you need to authenticate prior to accessing the document, you would like to be taken to the document immediately after authentication.SAML is an asynchronous protocol by design.  The SP-initiated login begins the flow by generating a SAML Authentication Request that gets redirected to the IDP.  At this point, the SP does not store any information about the request.  When the SAML response comes back from the IDP, the SP wouldn’t know anything about the initial deep-link that triggered the authentication request.  Luckily, SAML supports this with a parameter called RelayState.A RelayState is an HTTP parameter that can be included as part of the SAML request and SAML response.  In an SP-initiated login flow, the SP can set the RelayState parameter in the SAML request with additional information about the request.  A SAML IDP, upon receiving the SAML request, will take the RelayState value and simply attach it back as a HTTP parameter in the SAML response after the user has been authenticated.  This way, when the round trip completes, the SP can use the RelayState information to get additional context about the initial SAML authentication request.In the case of a deeplink, the SP will set the RelayState of the SAML request with the deep-link value.  When the SAML response comes back, the SP can use the RelayState value and take the authenticated user to the right resource.  Here is an example of the flow.Exposing SAML configuration in SPAs discussed before, SP needs the IDP configuration in order to complete the SAML setup.  While many ISVs choose to do this via support and email, the better way to do this is by exposing a self-service admin page for your customer’s IT administrator to enable SAML.  SAML supports metadata on both the IDP and SP side.  One way to configure the IDP/SP relationship on the SP side is to build the ability to receive an IDP metadata file and the ability to generate an SP metadata file for consumption by the IDP.  This is the preferred method.However, some ISVs choose to allow configuration of several key SAML parameters directly rather than through a metadata file.  Typical parameters would include the IDP redirect URL (for SAML Request), IssuerID, IDP Logout URL.  The SP must also allow the IDP public certificate to be uploaded or saved.Using metadata file is preferred because it can handle any future additions/enhancements in your SAML support without making UI changes that would otherwise be required if you expose specific SAML configuration parameters in your UI.Enabling SAML for everyone vs a subset of usersDepending on the nature of your application, there might be reasons to allow only a subset of users to be SAML enabled.  Imagine an application that is accessed by internal employees and external users like partners.  The employees may SAML into the app while the external users may use a separate set of credentials.Even in cases where the intent is to have all the users of a particular tenant to be SAML-enabled, it might be useful to enable just a subset of users during proof-of-concept, testing and roll-out to test out authentication with a smaller subset of users before going-live for the entire population.Implementing a “backdoor”This is particularly important where the entire population is intended to be SAML-enabled in your application.  Sometimes, there might be a mistake in the SAML configuration – or something changes in SAML IDP endpoints.  In any case, you do not want to completely locked out.  Having a backdoor available for administrator(s) to be able to lock into the system becomes extremely important.  This is often accomplished by having a “secret” login URL that does not trigger a SAML redirection when accessed. Typically, the administrator will use a username/password to login in and make the necessary changes to fix the problem.SAML for Mobile Native AppsWith SAML being an HTTP-based protocol, supporting SAML in a native mobile app may seem tricky.  You can actually achieve this quite easily by including an embedded webview in your native app to support the HTTP redirects.  When launching the webview, make sure you hit a URL on the SP side that will trigger a SAML redirect back to the IDP.  From this point on, the webview will carry out the SP-initiated login flow as it would happen in a browser.  When the SP finally receives the SAML response and authenticates the user successfully, your native app can leave the webview and proceed with the rest of the login bootstrap which typically involves some sort of a token (eg. OAuth) being generated and stored by the native app for subsequent access.  This is a fairly common approach used by many ISVs to support SAML integration with enterprises.For more details, see the technical overview for Okta Mobile Connect.Supporting Okta Mobile ConnectFor iOSOkta Mobile Connect allows native mobile apps to have seamless SSO support much like browser SSO experience.  Prerequisite is to support SAML in your native app using the embedded webview as described above.  Once that is accomplished, by implementing the following two characteristics, your application will work with Okta Mobile Connect.  The embedded web browser used for SAML authentication requests allows requests to be made to Okta’s URL schemes: “oktasso://” and “okta://”  The application has a registered URL scheme and supports being called by this URL scheme.When you are finished, publish your app to the App Store.

Sessions created for users with an assigned MFA policy will have a significantly constrained session and will not be able to access their applications.### Session CookieOkta utilizes a non-persistent HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user-agents such as a browser.  Session cookies have an  expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and are valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the session (logout) or browser application.### One-Time TokenOkta provides a mechanism to validate a [user's](users.html) credentials via the Session API and obtain a one-time token that can be later exchanged for a session cookie using flows detailed [here](/docs/examples/session_cookie.html) for specific deployment scenarios.A one-time token may only be used **once** to establish a session for a [user](users.html).  If the session expires or the [user](users.html) logs out of Okta after using the token, they will not be able to reuse the same one-time token to get a new session cookie.> One-time tokens are secrets and should be protected at rest as well as during transit. A one-time token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials## Session Model### Example~~~ json{    \"id\": \"000najcYVnjRS2aZG50MpHL4Q\",    \"userId\": \"00ubgaSARVOQDIOXMORI\",

In thissection we will use the \"Identity Provider metadata\" link from thesection above to configure Spring Security SAML. Once you've completedthese steps, you'll have a working example of connecting Okta to Spring.1.  Open the `securityContext.xml` file in your favorite text editor.    If you followed the instructions above for \"Installing the Spring    Security SAML sample application\" on Mac OS X, this file will be    located here at    `/Library/Tomcat/webapps/spring-security-saml2-sample/WEB-INF/securityContext.xml`    (Normally, you would do this step *before* running Maven or Gradle    to create the .war file you deploy to Tomcat. In this case, I'm    having you edit the file in the Tomcat path directly, since it's    easier to make small changes and test them this way).2.  Once you've opened the `securityContext.xml` file, add the XML below    to the end of the tag identified by this CSS selector syntax:    `#metadata > constructor-arg > list`.    ~~~ xml                                {metadata-url}                          5000                    ~~~3.  Make sure to replace the contents of `{metdata-url}` with the link    that you copied in step \\#9 of the \"Configuring Okta to work with    Spring Security SAML\" instructions above!**4.  Save the `securityContext.xml` file, then restart Tomcat5.  If you are using Mac OS X, you can restart Tomcat using the commands    below:    ~~~ shell    $ /Library/Tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh    $ /Library/Tomcat/bin/startup.sh    ~~~## Test the SAML integrationNow that you've set up an application in Okta and configured the SpringSecurity SAML example application to use that application, you're readyto test it out.There are two ways to test a SAML application: Starting from the Springapplication (\"SP initiated\") and starting from Okta (\"IdP initiated\").You will be testing both methods. In both cases, you will know of thetest worked when you see a screen that looks like the one below:![Authenticated user](/assets/img/spring-security-saml-authenticated-user.png)1.  Login from the Spring Security SAML sample application (This is    known as an \"SP initiated\" login)    -   Open the sample application in your browser:            -   Select the Okta IdP from the list        It will be a URL that starts with \"http://www.okta.com/\"    -   Click the \"Start single sign-on\" button.        ![Start single sign-on](/assets/img/spring-security-saml-idp-selection.png)2.  Login from Okta (This is known as an \"IdP initiated\" login)    -   Log in to your Okta organization    -   Click the button for the application you created in the        \"Configuring Okta to work with Spring Security SAML\" section        above:        ![Spring Security SAML](/assets/img/spring-security-saml-okta-chiclet.png)If you're able to get to the \"Authenticated User\" page using both of themethods above, then you're done.Congratulations on getting Okta working with Spring!## Next stepsAt this point, youshould understand how to set up an application in Okta and how toconfigure Spring to work with that Okta application.Once you have Okta working with the Spring Security SAML sample application,the next step is to move the configuration in`securityContext.xml` file for your production application.The specifics of how this will work willbe different depending on how your application is set up.If you want to learn more about SAML and what you should consider when writing a SAML implementation, ourin-depth [SAML guidance](http://developer.okta.com/docs/getting_started/saml_guidance.html)is a great place to learn more.Finally, if you got this far into this guide and still have questions,please reach out to me at: joel.franusic@okta.com"

This constraint applies to all users you import from other systems or applications such as Active Directory.  Your organization is the top-level namespace to mix and match logins from all your connected applications or directories.  Careful consideration of naming conventions for your login identifier will make it easier to onboard new applications in the future.Okta has a default ambiguous name resolution policy for logins.  Users can login with their non-qualified short-name (e.g. `isaac` with login *isaac@example.org*) as long as the short-name is still unique within the organization.> Avoid using a `login` with a `/` character.  Although `/` is a valid character according to [RFC 6531 section 3.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531#section-3.3), a user with this character in their `login` cannot be fetched by `login` ([see Get User by ID](#get-user-with-id)) due to security risks with escaping this character.#### Custom AttributesCustom attributes may be added to a user profile.  Custom attributes must be single-value (non-array) and have a data type of `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, or `null`.### Credentials ObjectSpecifies credentials for a user.  Credential types and requirements vary depending on the operation and security policy of the organization.Attribute         | DataType                                              | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Unique | Validation----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | -------| ----------password          | [Password Object](#password-object)                   |           |           | TRUE     | FALSE  |recovery_question | [Recovery Question Object](#recovery-question-object) |           |           | TRUE     | FALSE  |provider          | [Provider Object](#provider-object)                   |           |           | TRUE     | FALSE  |> Some credential values are **write-only**~~~ json{    \"credentials\": {        \"password\" : { \"value\": \"GoAw@y123\" },        \"recovery_question\": {            \"question\": \"Who's a major player in the cowboy scene?\",            \"answer\": \"Cowboy Dan\"        },        \"provider\": {            \"type\": \"OKTA\",            \"name\": \"OKTA\"        }    }}~~~#### Password ObjectSpecifies a password for a user.  A password value is a **write-only** property.  When a user has a valid password and a response object contains a password credential, then the Password Object will be a bare object without the `value` property defined (e.g. `password: {}`) to indicate that a password value exists.Attribute | DataType | MinLength         | MaxLength | Nullable | Unique | Validation--------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------- | ------ | -----------------value     | String   | *Password Policy* | 40        | TRUE     | FALSE  | *Password Policy*##### Default Password Policy- Must be a minimum of 8 characters- Must have a character from the following groups:  - Upper case  - Lower case  - Digit- Must not contain the user's login or parts of the the login when split on the following characters: `,` `.` `_` `#` `@`  - *For example, a user with login i.brock@example.org will not be able set password brockR0cks! as the password contains the login part brock*> Password policy requirements can be modified in the Okta Admin UI *(Security -> Policies)*#### Recovery Question ObjectSpecifies a secret question and answer that is validated when a user forgets their password.

Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation.  The system will perform group reconcilation during activation and assign the user to all applications via direct or inderect relationships (group memberships).  The user will have the `transitioningToStatus` property with a value of `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.  The user will have a `status` of `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.> The user will be emailed a one-time activation token if activated without a password> If the user is assigned to an application that is also configured for provisioning, the activation process will also trigger downstream provisioning to the application.

for a user's status.  Some operations are asynchronous while others are synchronous.  The user's current status limits what operations are allowed.  For example, you can't unlock a user that is `ACTIVE`.### Activate User{:.api .api-operation}POST /users/*:id*/lifecycle/activateActivates a user.  This operation can only be performed on users with a `STAGED` status.  Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation.  The user will have the `transitioningToStatus` property with a value of `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.  The user will have a status of `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.> Users that do not have a password must complete the welcome flow by visiting the activation link to complete the transition to `ACTIVE` status.##### Request Parameters{:.api .api-request .api-request-params}Parameter | Description                                     | Param Type | DataType | Required | Default--------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------id        | `id` of user                                    | URL        | String   | TRUE     |sendEmail | Sends an activation email to the user if `true` | Query      | Boolean  | FALSE    | TRUE##### Response Parameters{:.api .api-response .api-response-params}Returns empty object by default.
